We’ll get to the point where most users have personal instances running on their phones &amp; using an instance run by somebody else is a little like using the computer at the public library.</li><li name="1caf" id="1caf" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Most users will have five or six different accounts on different, themed instances, and keep their interests somewhat segregated. (We already see places like witches.town, a.weirder.earth, rich.gop, and oulipo.social, where specific interest groups congregate &amp; the local and federated feeds are much more useful; it may be that mastodon.social and other general-purpose instances will become a deviation from the norm.)</li><li name="3dc3" id="3dc3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">Some big company will jump on the bandwagon by hosting stock mastodon on expensive hardware, making proprietary changes, and heavily advertising it to less-savvy users who have no interest in federation. (Google plus replacement? After all, they nuked Orkut, Buzz, and Wave.) This would be the worst outcome, since the reasons people are interested in OpenSocial are essentially social and political, not technical, and having existing big players involved would run counter to those social and political rationales.</li></ul></div></div></section>
