While the consumption segment is broader in some ways (no skill or daring is required, nor any connections) it is narrower in others (one’s cultural capital here is tied entirely to one’s bank account, and wealth is not a good proxy for anything other than perhaps power, so not only is there no need to form a complex web of meaningful relationships within a fandom of this type, doing so is a negative since it limits the ‘fan’s ability to cut all ties with one fandom and gain social capital in another through buying and selling).</p><p name="43da" id="43da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Completely opening up licenses — flooding the market with new shows, licensing every anime in every region for simulcasting — paradoxically gives in to the apparent demands of the first group and demolishes them: if your cultural capital came from fansubbing TV rips, you are no longer useful to your cohort when Crunchyroll streams the new episode within a half an hour of broadcast (even if the official sub has none of the translation notes or karaoke subs or font changes that formed the basis of inter-fansub competition); if your cultural capital came from writing spicy and politically radical slash fics in private mailing lists under threat of bogus lawsuits, your cultural capital goes away when the showrunners begin to anticipate, manipulate, and lampshade the things you would say by lurking in fan communities and turning them into a kind of unpaid second writer’s room.</p><p name="1eff" id="1eff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If the expansion of capitalists into the previously-blocked markets has demolished the forces that previously unified your community and provided its metrics for value, there are only a couple things left to do:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="5483" id="5483" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Go much further (in obscurity, by focusing on older titles that are not available, or in transgression, by making transformative fan content so culturally radioactive that businesses cannot touch it),</li><li name="1abd" id="1abd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Continue what you’re doing in a community that keeps shrinking because of a loss of a sense of meaning, or</li><li name="aae8" id="aae8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Become a consumer-type (if you can afford it).</li></ol><p name="69e5" id="69e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Or, alternately, become one of the outside observers — the people who do not actually participate in the cultural production but collectively provide social capital through a consumption of fandom that’s wholly passive.</p><p name="9c60" id="9c60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is these folks who leave the outer ring of costly-signalling-based fandom first: they have not done any costly signalling themselves, but they watch fansubs because they don’t want to wait for an expensive dvd release that might never come, read fanfiction because they wish they were seeing these situations in the shows themselves, and (though totally silent and anonymous) their footprints produce view counts that justify cultural production.</p><p name="0819" id="0819" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When the costly-signalling side of fandom shrinks, though, and this group leaves, they will necessarily find less fulfillment in observation of the consumption side: a lovingly constructed spirk-tribble orgy is always going to be more fulfilling than a photograph of someone else’s collection of mass-produced dolls, because the former at least offers imaginative investment.</p><p name="9415" id="9415" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One could always graduate from an observer to a member of the costly signalling based fandom culture: while skill is prized and confers social capital, all that is actually necessary to join is sacrifice (ex., a willingness to write bad fanfiction in public, which may over time become good fanfiction); the consumption-based group is only open to you if you can afford to spend money on worthless objects, and class mobility is such that if you can’t, nothing within your power is likely to make it so that you can.</p><p name="7ef9" id="7ef9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thus far, I’ve tried to maintain neutrality here, but I think it’s clear that the costly signalling based segment is doing something valuable (including making meaningful cultural production, breaking down barriers, weakening the power of corporations and IP, being inclusive across class lines, and transforming an interest in media into the development of useful skills) and the consumption based section is a kind of shallow one-upsmanship between rich idiots; it benefits IP owners to cater to the latter and try to demolish the former, and until that process began in earnest and cultural shifts became noticeable in fandom spaces, there was very little interest in rigorously distinguishing between the two (who overlap anyway).</p><p name="fcca" id="fcca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I believe that the phenomenon people point to when they talk about the “degradation of geek culture” is explained by this tendency among IP owners combined with the development of a well-meaning but ill-advised taboo against the formerly common practice of treating consumption-based fandom as less “genuine” than creative cultural production: where once, watching Star Wars and owning figures was not enough to make you a “real geek” (one had to produce cosplay by hand, participate in a critical landscape situated in a combination of personal relationships and grass-roots forums like newsletters and mailing lists, draw fanart, write fanfiction, perform filk, or risk actual jail time by duplicating and distributing obscure and unavailable media), a general backlash against the concept of gatekeeping has blurred the lines between a community built on skill production and a target market built on astroturfing and conspicuous consumption.</p><p name="2b06" id="2b06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These two currents have always existed, but when we stopped distinguishing between them at all (even in the ad-hoc and selective way we did previously — “he’s a geek but not a REAL geek”) and began to talk about a single unified community where we had previously given more weight to the productive segment, we produce the illusion of a decreasingly productive community (and would, even were there no changes in individual productive versus consumptive habits at all and no change in the “geek” population). A bias against gatekeeping is often justified in terms of equity, and we point to women and minorities, but women and minorities are actually more likely to have been part of this creative-productive camp and are excluded from a consumption-based social economy.</p><p name="8ef5" id="8ef5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Can we save the valuable parts of these communities without saving arbitrary IP-based access barriers? I think the demoscene shows that we can.</p><p name="f8f2" id="f8f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the 80s, we had the cracktro scene, which came out of the crack scene. Basically, the ‘observer’ class (wanting access to software they could not afford) was being served by a handful of technical experts who figured out how to circumvent anti-piracy measures on software distributed by floppy to unnetworked machines. Once a ‘scene’ developed, people associated their skill with their identity (handles usually), and we started to see artistic expression (cracktros). Once enough people got close to the skill ceiling for copy-protection circumvention, the art became more important. (This is a feature common to most subcultures built around skill: skills developed for one reason will broaden through a mix of elite competition and elite cooperation, since social capital is based on both individual skill and one’s willingness to build and support strong supportive ties among one’s peers. Friendly competition, in this context, fuels exploration ever more tangential to the community’s ostensible reason for existence, and the role of individual ego can cause this exploration to become broader and more expressive; meanwhile, stronger social links become both part of collective social capital in the scene and a channel through which knowledge can flow.) By the early 90s, the art was the main thing, and the cracktro scene became the demoscene, entirely concerned with impressive technical-artistic productions, music videos in software; the demo scene still exists today. This transition happened right before the double-whammy of widespread internet access and the shift from floppy to cdrom distribution of shrink-wrapped software, both of which dramatically changed the technical landscape of copy-protection and anti-piracy controls — rendering the difficult technical skills developed for copy-protection circumvention itself meaningless. In other words, because there was a large and robustly socially connected community of technical ‘insiders’ in the cracktro scene, it was able to divorce itself entirely from a passively-consuming observer group and instead the hackers gave each other social capital, and this happened right before that observer group stopped having any reason to be involved in the scene.</p><p name="96c0" id="96c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Can other fanwork communities make this kind of shift?</p><p name="c7bd" id="c7bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was seeing some evidence of this in the fanfiction space 15 years ago: highly formally experimental fanfics, often extremely long, that could not possibly be re-integrated into canon, and would not be (since it was providing very fringe appeals). For instance, I was seeing Evangelion fics that were integrating Joyce, OuLiPo, Ligotti… Evangelion manages to integrate a lot (no fewer than 3 officially-sanctioned low-stakes high school AUs, and one official tie-in with horse racing), but could not integrate lipogramy. While every transformative fanwork arguably ‘fixes’ some ancestor-work by satisfying needs or desires that the ancestor does not, which desires are satisfied by corporate IP is determined by certain material forces: satisfying one desire may take up space, mindshare, and budget that prevents some other desire from being satisfied, or may alienate part of the target audience, or may confuse newcomers, and while separating a franchise into multiple semi-isolated properties may mitigate some of these problems, it can make others worse. Similarly, in fanart, Jim Davis could not possibly recuperate r/imsorryjon — the handful of times he tried to bring in any kind of dark material were massive failures that damaged the brand, because Garfield owes its continued existence almost entirely to the notion that it is uncomplicated and inoffensive, easy to slap onto any other enterprise (such as GarfieldEats) in order to lend the benefit of its instant recognizability and nostalgia value.</p><p name="55c0" id="55c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Something similar may have happened in cosplay, with the rise of creative steampunk cosplay simultaneous with the progressive professionalization of cosplay tailors: round the same time that cosplaying well-known characters became a matter of ordering a costume from an officially licensed vendor, you started seeing this community popping up within cosplay based on imaginative exploration of an aesthetic. In other words, just as some sections of the community became captured by more and more organized and centralized business concerns, people escaped it by eschewing IP entirely and focusing on showing technical skills in a personally expressive way. I don’t think steampunk was ever articulated as an explicit rejection of and response to a growing focus on film-accurate cosplay, high expected production values, and professional or semi-professional figures in both cosplay modeling and cosplay tailoring, but it bloomed simultaneously and presented an alternative set of values — along with similar trends like crossplay and the cosplaying of individual fan OCs (notably among Homestuck fans).</p><p name="0378" id="0378" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">But, other domains haven’t shifted in this way. I’d love to see a demoscene around animated text art drawing on the fansub community, but that doesn’t seem like it’s going to happen. And you can see a total failure to evade corporate capture in the hackerspace/maker scene.</p></div></div></section>
