I asked GPT-2 instead. The results are rambling, self-contradictory, obliquely disturbing, and vaguely racist — just like what you’d get if you asked your actual grandparents these questions!</em></p><p name="557f" id="557f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Did you go to college?</strong></p><p name="08ae" id="08ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yes, I went to Eastern Michigan University, where I graduated with a degree in aerospace engineering in 2009. I work for Raytheon as an R&amp;D engineer.</p><p name="8566" id="8566" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How did you decide to become a father?</p><p name="d2a7" id="d2a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My girlfriend at the time asked me if I wanted to be a father, so I was more than ready. We were expecting to be a family for about three years before we had a boy, but something ended up coming along, and I became a father in a very short amount of time.</p><p name="1b05" id="1b05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What did you study?</strong></p><p name="1132" id="1132" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the visual arts, I graduated from the School of Visual Arts, a conservatory in the City University of New York, which I then attended for six years as a graduate student before completing a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in Printmaking and Drawing with an emphasis in American contemporary art at the College of Charleston, where I was taught by renowned Art Directors Barbara Betcher and Larry Evans. I also studied at the School of Architecture, which in part led me to attend the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 2005.</p><p name="5077" id="5077" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Do you wish you had the opportunity to go to college?</strong> Do you wish your parents had spent more time working to provide for your family? You could say “yes” to almost all of these questions. If you say “no” to all of them, you’re fine. Are you an anal child? Are you allergic to your first colonoscopy? Nah, nah. Most of us are alright with these types of things. As of 2016, 16 million Americans, or one in four people over the age of 16, have pre-diabetes.</p><p name="b08f" id="b08f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What did you do instead of college?</strong></p><p name="edf8" id="edf8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Up until 2001, I did a bit of teaching. I read a lot of medieval literature, which was very interesting. My husband was a judge and a judge with a small law firm in Toronto. Our sons were young and didn’t have the capacity to do something like that, but they were in their 20s, and we encouraged them to think outside the box. We used to go to U of T where we were in the law school.</p><p name="44cb" id="44cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like most who started a family, I was very much in the entertainment business.</p><p name="15ce" id="15ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Did you have any pets growing up?</strong></p><p name="dadb" id="dadb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had three cats: Chloe and Maisie, my parents’ cats. And then my best friend Tommy.</p><p name="137a" id="137a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How do they compare?</p><p name="787c" id="787c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well they are kind of alike. Tommy is a sweetheart and a three-year-old shep. And he is pretty happy being in that cage and not being out here. [Laughs]</p><p name="de2d" id="de2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The “Love” mural, which was featured in The Last Gasp, got the biggest response of the three; is there a particular song that played in the minds.</p><p name="984f" id="984f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What was it like living there?</strong></p><p name="5182" id="5182" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I remember so many of my friends from St. Pete being in the grade school I lived in. There was a great sense of community. It felt like you lived in a community. And a lot of the other kids, a lot of the kids from my grade school went on to start their own organizations, their own churches and things like that. It felt like you were living in a community that had similar values. So that’s the greatest thing that I’m blessed to have had the opportunity to do and lived.</p><p name="ba73" id="ba73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What was your room like?</strong> Were you familiar with Huxley’s Brave New World? Did you ever sneak into the Union’s Dungeon? I didn’t. What was I doing in there? I was hanging out with that guy I talked to last night. So I am a woman. But I’m not like other women, because there is nothing worse in the universe than a woman who is allowed to be equal to a man. I couldn’t possibly take it. What am I? I’m a nobody. I don’t belong anywhere.</p><p name="7ad3" id="7ad3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What are the most difficult and most rewarding things about growing older?</strong></p><p name="16e6" id="16e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hank: For me the difficult and the rewarding, depending on the age, are that the age goes on but your patience continues to grow. As you age there’s a higher tolerance to pain and discomfort, and that’s why it’s a pleasurable thing to age.</p><p name="dfb6" id="dfb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">William: I don’t think I think about my age at all until it’s in the last decade of my life or two years after it. I’m fairly surprised to find that I’ve done this.</p><p name="d2e2" id="d2e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What do you want your children and grandchildren to remember about you?</strong></p><p name="8651" id="8651" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Love and resilience. At my wit’s end, my world still more and more plunged into the black hole of its own despair.</p><p name="613c" id="613c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But what about you? Are you here to tell your tale?</p><p name="8c3d" id="8c3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From my most vivid memories to the one I call a daydream</p><p name="d8e7" id="d8e7" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I had a book with me…”</p><p name="6de9" id="6de9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My entire life I loved books. I was entranced by their beauty and wisdom, their beauty and wisdom in sharing the life and knowledge of the creators of this wonderful art.</p><p name="1ae2" id="1ae2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What kinds of clothes, hobbies, or slang terms were popular when you were a teenager?</strong></p><p name="c4c5" id="c4c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Appropriately enough, a lot of my friends are artists, and there’s a good chance that you’ve made an art piece or done something yourself. My favorite color is usually navy blue, but I also like a lot of colors, and I did make a lot of new friend at PFAFA when I was a kid. My fellow students would go to Juilliard. And I went to the Parthenon.</p><p name="25c5" id="25c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What was your least favorite thing about school?</strong></p><p name="fb45" id="fb45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The whole experience. I came out of high school with an anxiety disorder. That part of my life was so painful that I wanted to take my own life. It was awful, and nothing ever went back to normal.</p><p name="46bb" id="46bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do you have any advice for someone who wants to get into improv?</p><p name="77ae" id="77ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The best advice I can give for anyone who’s thinking about going into comedy is to keep doing what you love. You are special. You’re not a lesser version of anyone else.</p><p name="c2db" id="c2db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What were your friends in school like?</strong></p><p name="af47" id="af47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How did you feel about them when you first met? Did you look down on them for not knowing a few thousand words?</p><p name="9da4" id="9da4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Did you have any problems getting along with them in college?</p><p name="1390" id="1390" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Did any of them ever come up to you and give you the stink eye?</p><p name="6757" id="6757" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Were you friends with anyone in college who seems to be at all of your other adult life’s activities?</p><p name="6122" id="6122" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Has anyone who isn’t on your team come up to you and said “fuck you” to you?</p><p name="0fca" id="0fca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What were your friends like?</strong> Were there any notable women who were there?</p><p name="d7ab" id="d7ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">H: Well, Paul and I had the first three years of being married before we ever had a house and we never did. That was also back when we were kids. The only other girl who was there was my friend Zoe and her father Bob.</p><p name="55cd" id="55cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">B: Zoe and I were having a pretty rough life in that relationship. But her father was a major proponent of us starting a family. He was really a big support for us starting a family and he tried to talk us out of it.</p><p name="b236" id="b236" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Who was your favorite teacher?</strong></p><p name="a156" id="a156" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Everyone I had in school was very nice, very wonderful. Everyone I’ve worked with in the past 15 years in comics has been incredibly respectful and kind. So it’s always been good to me.</p><p name="c42e" id="c42e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’re very heavily involved with indie comics; how did you find your way into that world?</p><p name="4b99" id="4b99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was introduced to indie comics by my older brother. He owned his own bookstore, and for some reason he was telling me, “Just check out this book by Jughead Jones!” And I finally just went see it. It turned.</p><p name="a3f0" id="a3f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What was your favorite subject?</strong></p><p name="ed8e" id="ed8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">NARRATOR: So far, nothing has been able to explain how space can be empty.</p><p name="1429" id="1429" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">ALBERT TEMPLETON (Southern Illinois University): The total vacuum may not appear empty at all. There are important energies associated with space and time that make it possible for stars to shine.</p><p name="2b03" id="2b03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">NARRATOR: The latest theory: To explain the cosmic void, we can use gravity to lift the vacuum and bring in matter and energy. But to get the gravity to last, space needs to have a tiny bit of mass.</p><p name="d52f" id="d52f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What was your first job?</strong></p><p name="dc00" id="dc00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hi there, my first job was on the wheel of an eighteen wheeler on the Pacific Coast Highway at Makaha, Hawaii. We drove up the Salton Sea, which is a salt lake which fed the city of Salton Sea. The showroom was located down in the dust in the back, and there was a state of the art filming set up there.</p><p name="999f" id="999f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What led to you pursuing this job at “Growing Pains”?</p><p name="b3f8" id="b3f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">David Foster said, “if you want to be an actor, you’ve got to be an actor.”</p><p name="6896" id="6896" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What was your favorite job?</strong></p><p name="a4b5" id="a4b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I went from working at a school for the blind to working in Prenatal Care at Planned Parenthood. I loved all of it. It wasn’t until I had my daughters that I really felt the need to do something different. I loved seeing that first infant and seeing them grow up.</p><p name="b625" id="b625" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How do you view the issue of women and men in the work force?</p><p name="be43" id="be43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think it’s important for people to realize that I wasn’t so good in school at reading and writing. I was great at math, but I failed chemistry.</p><p name="fbb6" id="fbb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is your favorite book?</strong></p><p name="784c" id="784c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My favorite book is the late Ray Bradbury’s novel, Fahrenheit 451, but it is the story, just as much as the series, of a young woman named Vivian Gornick, who goes on to create a critical and even revolutionary piece of literature.</p><p name="6559" id="6559" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your process is a balancing act. You start in the middle and work your way out.</p><p name="3554" id="3554" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do you think you could quit now, at 30?</p><p name="43b3" id="43b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Probably not.</p><p name="634c" id="634c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do you know someone like that?</p><p name="8255" id="8255" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No, but it is a great question.</p><p name="f28f" id="f28f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why is it your favorite book?</strong> What makes you just plain crazy about it?</p><p name="d13d" id="d13d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Steve: I love the characters in it. How did they go through the experience of deciding whether or not to leave their host? I want to know how they all got through that crisis.</p><p name="2eb7" id="2eb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rj: The third I want to know is why did two (or more?) people want to get back to Earth?</p><p name="ed6e" id="ed6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Steve: Where did they start the trip?</p><p name="6ac2" id="6ac2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rj: That’s the part of the book that got me.</p><p name="8338" id="8338" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is your favorite movie?</strong></p><p name="7e6b" id="7e6b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dudley. Because he’s such a little guy. So very trusting. I’m in the movies a lot, so I’m just really looking forward to seeing what he does with this.</p><p name="0fcb" id="0fcb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When are you and the others shooting?</p><p name="7a7e" id="7a7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, in the beginning of January, so January 16th, 17th, 18th, and then it will ramp up for the whole year. And I hope they’re well taken care of, otherwise I would never get here.</p><p name="1e6e" id="1e6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why are the movies?</p><p name="b1b4" id="b1b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had been looking.</p><p name="1585" id="1585" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is it your favorite movie?</strong></p><p name="4ea3" id="4ea3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">*For honorable mention…</p><ul class="postList"><li name="8800" id="8800" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">My personal favorite is Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (The Star Wars) because it had such a lovable cast and it was underrated, and I love (Ren and Stimpy’s) Ren and Stimpy, and I love 90’s Ninja Turtles which is a comedy.</li></ul><p name="c826" id="c826" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What was your favorite book when you were young?</strong> What do you read now?</p><p name="15db" id="15db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Book: The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien</p><p name="695e" id="695e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Author: J.R.R. Tolkien</p><p name="9b4c" id="9b4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Favorite quote: “What we read, we pass on, not to be forgotten.”</p><p name="8d44" id="8d44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What was your favorite movie when you were young?</strong></p><p name="c695" id="c695" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Probably the Billy Wilder script “Jazz” (1960). I loved the conceit that a living, breathing, functioning rock star and poet is suddenly in New York City and has no idea how to navigate the land of big-city women and society’s conventions. He’s alone in the big city, without a date, without a sense of belonging. He moves into the big apartment at the Four Seasons and rents it for two years in the hope that he’ll be able to take the band to Europe.</p><p name="5f72" id="5f72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Who were your heroes or role models when you were young?</strong></p><p name="ea59" id="ea59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My hero growing up was Bruce Lee. I’d be doing all the stuff he did and I couldn’t do it at all because it wasn’t a martial art I knew, but I tried and I didn’t like what I did. I was like, I wanna be him. But I couldn’t do it. But that to me is the ultimate. I’m not saying anybody can do what he did. I’m saying that there are people in that world that can and there are people that can’t.</p><p name="8789" id="8789" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What do you remember about your parents?</strong> What do they do for a living?</p><p name="4c6c" id="4c6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s start with John. I knew him as kind of a house preacher but, uh… I’d say we were pretty close. Not close enough for his wife to divorce him, I hope.</p><p name="622b" id="622b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We talked about his family so often. Well, like I said, it was Christmas morning, and he was making all of these wonderful mittens… We talked about his dad for weeks and weeks. And I remember every morning having to hear about his grandmother and his mother and his sister.</p><p name="350d" id="350d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How many brothers and sisters do you have?</strong></p><p name="5b38" id="5b38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think that the researchers at Landmark Legal Foundation in Tucson, Ariz., know exactly who the illegal aliens are. They may know which states they’re residing in, but the number that is written on their face does not stand up to scrutiny, especially when the federal government provided details of the illegal aliens to local law enforcement.</p><p name="3282" id="3282" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The federal government says that the Central American children are included in the count of unaccompanied children because they are arriving with family. Illegal aliens who enter the United States with legal families, however, are not.</p><p name="d8fc" id="d8fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How did you meet your spouse?</strong></p><p name="0114" id="0114" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A: I met my spouse in college in Indiana and she introduced me to her parents and then we married in 1995.</p><p name="83a8" id="83a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Q: How long did you have her?</p><p name="b470" id="b470" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A: Five years</p><p name="61f0" id="61f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Q: Where did you meet her?</p><p name="b55c" id="b55c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A: I met her at the University of Maryland (Md.)</p><p name="8918" id="8918" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Q: What do you like to do for fun?</p><p name="0388" id="0388" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A: We love to travel.

She reached the east of Mykonos where the order “detecting activities” took place, the ship was sent back to Turkey after more than three.</p><p name="8277" id="8277" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Where were you when you heard that the Titanic had sunk?</strong> How did your parents react?</p><p name="beb0" id="beb0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">JM: My wife was 18 at the time. My mom, Anna, was at work. She couldn’t sleep. She had stayed up all night thinking about the news. I was on the phone with her at 7:00 a.m. What was really awful was when I called her from the office. I heard this urgent tone coming from the phone. I answered and she said, “You have to wake up. It’s not good.” She’s telling me everything.</p><p name="c9c4" id="c9c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Where were you when you heard that the Bolsheviks had taken over Russia?</strong></p><p name="0ed4" id="0ed4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Stalin: I was worried by the news. I was told, through the Bolsheviks, that the members of the upper castes in the Soviet power were guilty of murder and treachery against the people. The time had come for the people to make an example of those privileged strata to show them that the working class and the peasants were in revolt against their rule. I didn’t get much time to think about it because on September 7 I had to go to the Front to save the Battalion and the other.</p><p name="bcc9" id="bcc9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Where were you when you heard that Germany had been defeated?</strong> We were bombed, all over Europe. And Germany was attacked. Now, you know, Hitler probably would have invaded Britain or Poland if he had a chance, but it wasn’t even an option for him. And so they had to wait until World War Two to invade the country. I think that’s the way it went down, and I do understand that. I do not understand why this is a country that you have on the West Coast of North America with these splendid libraries and institutions of higher learning and scientific research.</p><p name="fbbe" id="fbbe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Where were you when you heard that Louis XIV had ascended to the throne?</strong> Was there a “bar-b-que” at the Elysée or Queen Marguerite VII had replaced the Empress to marry him? Did the Parisian ladies and gentlemen clutch their pearls and swoon at the fall of royalty? The French people have been in a state of ferment since the previous year’s Napoleonic war, sparked by what historians today think was Louis’s ill-conceived attempt to reunite the Rhine alliance and eventually conquer France itself. What kind of history student hasn’t sat?</p><p name="6d9b" id="6d9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Where were you when you heard that the Confederacy had surrendered?</strong></p><p name="b099" id="b099" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t remember.

I think I was closer to it at the time. I think the concept of fighting for the institution that had done us so much harm seemed more painful than the end result.</p><p name="60d9" id="60d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Where were you when you heard that the Declaration of Independence had been signed?</strong> Were you busy sweeping up? It’s no wonder, my fellow Californians, that your Congress is “Astonishingly’ Bad at Doing Its Job”.</p><p name="0af6" id="0af6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Admittedly, the United States isn’t perfect. The country has too many gun laws and too much money to make up for all the ignorance of the poor, who are victims of two centuries of disenfranchisement, racism and brutality. We’re so religious, too, that we can’t even agree on what god we worship.</p><p name="c4f4" id="c4f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Where were you when you heard that the moon had been colonized?</strong> Pish-Tosh: We were doing a DVD shoot with the Empress of Russia who’s a real beauty. Just sitting around while she watched one of the big action films and sort of indulged in that. She’s really into making things. And then, you know, the movies that I’m used to being in, being out there, you know, in “Andromeda,” a female president. It was interesting. That was also an experience, because there were three of us.</p><p name="4891" id="4891" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Where were you when you heard that unicorns had been discovered in a cave in North Korea?</strong> I can hardly believe that after everything I’m hearing, to have found such a thing you didn’t know about as I had. To think that I would not have even heard of such a thing, let alone be near it.”</p><p name="beb3" id="beb3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ooh, it was hard to bring some distance between myself and that smile.</p><p name="7b52" id="7b52" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“My advice to you would be to simply read a book about ghosts and devils, then come look me up if you ever get the chance.”</p><p name="a264" id="a264" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Where were you when you heard that the world had ended?</strong></p><p name="4526" id="4526" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The end of the world…really?</p><p name="23f6" id="23f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, we didn’t know what it was. Our neighbors were at a wedding. My parents were out for the day. We never saw the light of day. We had radio on in the house, and there was a newscaster. He said, “We’ve got a serious problem out there in the desert. There’s a bad wind blowing. Maybe the dust devils are going to come into the house. We need you to be on the scene.”</p><p name="ab45" id="ab45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Where were you when you heard that Nibiru had crashed into the earth and annihilated it?</strong> By what measures have you decided that it did indeed arrive? If it did, is the system within which Nibiru works now changed as a result? This is what I really want to know, since it is logical to assume that you must have based any decision about Nibiru’s arrival on your understanding of the old laws of nature you have to credit for your current system, and that such a change must have occurred by a previously unknown process involving N. bj Ophiuchus.</p><p name="e812" id="e812" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Where were you when you heard that Half Life 3 had been released?</strong> As I recall the news was universally ecstatic. Did the anticipation and buzz factor in particular get you involved in the process of creating Half Life 3?</p><p name="0f4e" id="0f4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Davey Hodder: When we officially announced the sequel we didn’t have the name and we had a rather basic one to show at E3 — Lambda and Lambda Force — so many of you had speculated the codename but didn’t know what it meant, so we were starting to feel the pressure. As it turned out the full title was more.</p><p name="b062" id="b062" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Where were you when you heard that pigs flew?</strong> I was sitting in my basement, watching the afternoon. Nobody said anything, but I knew. No more than I knew that most people knew I saw flying pigs. What did you know about pigs that makes you say “I saw a flying pig”? I didn’t even know pigs flew. When I walked out of the kitchen, my neighbor didn’t say anything to me, but I knew he had seen it, too. How do you know that a flying pig was a true story? It was a good tale, it had good storytelling qualities.</p><p name="432d" id="432d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Where were you when you heard that the full-sized GPT-2 model had been released?</strong></p><p name="7f76" id="7f76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, how did this press release stack up against expectations?</p><p name="940f" id="940f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My expectations were a bit on the low side, as a key factor was that the GPT-2 didn’t have a default menu/backlit keyboard option. Many options were simplified to allow only two pushbuttons, an integrated (relatively) low-power display (230 mA output), and the ability to quickly access backlit keys for even greater convenience.</p><p name="c07e" id="c07e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Where were you when you heard that Sargon II had conquered the Babylonian empire?</strong> I was lying on my couch watching Farscape, eating M&amp;M’s and drinking water. (The M&amp;M’s I was eating were Twix.) I remember thinking that to conquer an empire, a king must be absolutely celibate. I also remember the feeling I got in my stomach. It was as though I could only take one thing in the world. And that thing was King Sargon II.</p><p name="431b" id="431b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ll be the first to admit that, at the time.</p><p name="1084" id="1084" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Where were you when you heard that Arthur had died in battle against Mordred?</strong> I came in the night and hastened in joy to his chamber, only to find him not there.

Or do the towers in our shattered remains indicate the presence of something greater than we can imagine? To me, the Tower of Ghenjei speaks of nothing less than a corruption beyond comprehension.” Arundel: “What?”</p><p name="d7f8" id="d7f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">L’Arachel: “The corrupted Ring of Hengstennin.

Anyone else who thinks I’m too lazy to go through the whole process of interviewing people probably doesn’t have the time, and the rest probably might think I’m a complete asshole for asking people on a forum they prefer to stay in the shadows to openly share their thoughts, because apparently nobody wants to be on camera while being interviewed.</p><p name="ad1e" id="ad1e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, it’s a really embarrassing scenario for me.</p><p name="b678" id="b678" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Tell me about some of your favorite songs.</strong></p><p name="9d31" id="9d31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You know, I’ve got a lot of favorites. It’s a weird thing because I try to pick the lesser known but it’s all good stuff. I always want the surprise. I don’t want something that everyone is expecting. I like singing for fun and I like singing live for that. I like singing to my mom. I enjoy the challenge of trying to do something like that, and to stay behind the mic a little bit, and this was actually something that happened last year on “Turn.” I was sitting.</p><p name="1947" id="1947" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Tell me about some of the places where you’ve been happiest.</strong> The truth is, I don’t know exactly where you are happy or where you feel most alive and then I also know that there is not a single street where we would both like to be. I would never wish that upon anyone.</p><p name="cc2b" id="cc2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My favourite place is Belgium. What makes me happy? You probably think it’s because it is your favourite country in the world. It’s no secret that I’m a lover of Belgium and still feel extremely connected to that place.
