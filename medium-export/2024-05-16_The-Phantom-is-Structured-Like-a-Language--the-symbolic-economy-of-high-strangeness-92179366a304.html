Some of you may only know me from my popular work, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Complete Guide to Mysterious Animals</em> and its many sequels, and may be wondering why I’m speaking at a university at all. Actually, I think all these subjects are related in an interesting way — one that computer scientists are just now beginning to experiment with at scale, with potentially dire exopolitical consequences.</p><p name="e12b" id="e12b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let me first say that the primary characteristic of a genuine encounter with the paranormal is strangeness. It is not merely strange, but <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">highly</em> strange: some mix of creepy and comical, or caring and threatening, that prevents us from modeling the being’s intentions, or some lapse in logic or impossible action making it impossible to reason about the situation.</p><p name="d769" id="d769" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Okay, but on the other hand, do you notice how I mentioned modeling intentions, reasoning, following logic… all of these are human attributes — seemingly uniquely human to some degree, though we have built computers to simulate them.</p><p name="7ea4" id="7ea4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While we have some reports of pets reacting to paranormal events (and reports of wildlife mostly going <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">quiet</em> in response to them), we have no way to know what animals perceive in the event of a close encounter.</p><p name="2815" id="2815" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What humans perceive differs from case to case, seemingly related to some innate trait (such as ‘being on the right wavelength’ in Keel, or hypnotic suggestibility): we have cases where four people have been in a car that was ‘abducted’ where all four independently reported exactly the same thing, and similar cases where all four reported dramatically different abduction experiences with weird points of commonality, and similar cases where three of them had abduction experiences while the fourth one just felt bodily paralysis and watched the other three jerk around in a trance for a few hours.</p><p name="6836" id="6836" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It seems like whatever we make contact with at least sometimes makes contact directly with human intellect. As Keel and others document, there are cases where physical evidence seems to be faked by other contactees acting seemingly under post-hypnotic suggestion, so it’s entirely possible that the entire mechanism of action is hypnotic and hard physical evidence remains hidden away to be shown only to selected individuals because it’s essentially hallucinatory.</p><p name="8146" id="8146" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let us imagine for a moment that this is the case: that all paranormal activity is, in a sense, “all in our heads”.</p><p name="de96" id="de96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This does not make it any less mysterious! There is a force here, causing people to have dramatic meaningful (or meaningless) experiences that fundamentally derail their lives. It is very multifarious but has certain culturally-specific patterns and other more universal patterns.</p><p name="ac7c" id="ac7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s mimetic: it mimics familiar forms, and caters itself to the expectations of the observer; at the same time, it is anti-structural: it always contains impossible juxtapositions, typically ones that create a meta-level contradiction, (one of Hoftstadter’s paradoxical strange loops).</p><p name="603e" id="603e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hansen’s book, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Trickster and the Paranormal</em>, goes into some detail into this and falls prey to the law of eristic escallation in the process; it is worth infecting yourself with. But I think I have the answer. Language is the alien.</p><p name="ed19" id="ed19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">is</em> language? Humans have it; when a human being lacks language, a lot of people unfortunately consider them less than human.</p><p name="2731" id="2731" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reverse is also true: if you met a talking pig, you’d probably stop eating bacon, because you’d begin to consider a pig to be an honorary human (or at least an honorary person). Other apes do not have language; despite promising vocabulary acquisition, no gorilla or chimpanzee has ever developed a sense of consistent grammar better than that of a parrot, which is to say worse than a three year old human child. Certain kinds of mental operations are either heavily assisted by language or depend upon it entirely: logic and mathematics, in their larger structures, require chunking that’s fundamentally linguistic, so performing these tasks is primarily linguistic symbol manipulation &amp; could probably not be done by someone who had never acquired a first language.</p><p name="0f73" id="0f73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Modelling of intentions is much easier when someone can outright tell you what their intentions are, but also when you have neat handles for complex configurations of emotions such as “cuckoldry” or “cheering for the underdog” or “schadenfreude”; at the same time, many of our most fundamental intention-mirroring techniques, the ones that seem basic and pre-linguistic like following eye movement, are deeply entangled with the development of conversational turn-taking norms in early childhood.</p><p name="0601" id="0601" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Did you know that 78% of the time, when cats groom each other, it ends in a fight? Two cats, who want to groom and want to be groomed, who trust each other enough to begin grooming each other, and almost 80% of the time they end up in a physical altercation. I think language is what separates us from the cats. Language gives us the ability to negotiate but also the ability to imagine another with whom to negotiate.</p><p name="a448" id="a448" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But language, while it exists inside our heads, does not exist completely inside any one person’s head. If I do not know a particular Japanese word, that does not make it no longer part of Japanese, right? But perhaps if nobody knew a word at all, it could no longer be part of the language. If it’s written down in a hidden tome and the tome is re-discovered it might be resurrected and released like Dracula into the modern language. That’s called time-binding. So some of language is distributed between different people’s heads, and some of it is in cold storage so to speak in books and recordings and graffiti and such. It’s maybe like one organism, or possibly like an ecosystem whose boundaries aren’t like the boundaries of our own: a purely memetic ecosystem, that abides by its own physical laws.</p><p name="76da" id="76da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We have all made a pact with this rival astral kingdom of language, or this swarming hive-minded elder god of language. We give it nearly total control over our bodies, and in exchange we get an improved ability to cooperate and engage in complex long-term planning. This demonic pact has led us to our current position, technologically capable of holding earth’s biosphere hostage but not socially capable of talking ourselves down.</p><p name="b01a" id="b01a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Jacques Vallee has suggested that the close encounter phenomenon is a control system: that the purpose of close encounters is to seed stories about close encounters so that those stories become myths and those myths become something people live by. He was unable, however, to imagine what it was that such myths might teach. What do Simonton’s pancakes mean?</p><p name="f519" id="f519" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t think they’re trying to teach us anything. I think we’re meeting Language face to face for the first time, and inside the pleasant exterior, thin as paper, is a whirling void of incomprehensible chaos — the Other, just like the Self.</p><figure name="b522" id="b522" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*h15ZbPR9ikHnv0gYoUyTGQ.png" data-width="2912" data-height="1632" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*h15ZbPR9ikHnv0gYoUyTGQ.png"></figure></div></div></section>
