<section name="ee64" class="section section--body section--first section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="a853" id="a853" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">I completely understand the desire to make big changes. I don’t find the current system sufficient. (The term closest to describing my political sentiments is “anarchist”.) That said, I can’t stand by the idea that a “middle finger vote” is justified, particularly when it’s unlikely to result in real change; breaking down a complex and resilient system like a government requires a strategy.</p><p name="c65f" id="c65f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you want someone to tear the system down, you will probably want to elect someone like Gary Johnson: he has a clear idea of which parts of the system he would like to remove and how to remove them.</p><p name="94bf" id="94bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Trump is unlikely to tear it all down. He has no reason to want to perform major restructuring; he doesn’t have enough understanding of the current structure to know how to disassemble it; even if he did, he probably couldn’t keep his attention focused on the task of tearing down government for long enough for it to happen. A Trump presidency will be comparable to that of Bush: more of the same, but with more mistakes.</p><p name="a0fd" id="a0fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To tear a system down requires more than bringing in an unpredictable wildcard. While someone like that is unpredictable in the short term, the distribution of their behavior is predictable at scale: a random walk seldom goes very far and often returns to the center, not despite but because of its randomness.</p><p name="e1ff" id="e1ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">With regard to the negative sides of the status quo, I think even this favors Clinton. She will avoid war and torture whenever possible — after all, they have bad PR — and to the extent that she condones them at all she will do so very carefully. Trump will not avoid war: he will act in accordance with momentary displays of dominance, rather than in accordance with risk.</p></div></div></section>
