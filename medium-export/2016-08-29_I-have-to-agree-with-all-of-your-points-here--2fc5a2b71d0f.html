But, at the same time, on the scale set by the other TOS reboot films, this one is the closest to Star Trek — in the sense that it has an interesting and complex plot, ensemble cast drama, &amp; elements of the utopian subtext that characterized TOS. The other two have leaned much closer to generic-sci-fi-action — though Star Trek movies have always been a lot more action-oriented and a lot less talky than the shows.</p><p name="8c95" id="8c95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Was the jokeyness a bit out of character for a Trek film? Sure, particularly for the reboot franchise; on the other hand, the other films in this group have been particularly over-serious grimdark fare (even as they used absurd plotlines that made “Spock’s Brain” and “Move Along Home” look normal), and so expanding upon the only redeeming quality of previous scripts — one-off jokes — is justified. (This is hardly out of line for Trek films; after all, the best — or at least most interesting — Trek film is The Journey Home, which is also the silliest.)</p><p name="35ec" id="35ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I more or less agree with MovieBob’s review here: Star Trek Beyond is, as a sci-fi action film, passable; as a Trek film it’s mediocre; as a Trek film in the reboot franchise, it’s surprisingly good, and would have been indicative of a worthwhile series had it been the first film. Because it’s the third, and because we’ve already lost some of the cast, the reboots as a whole probably won’t be able to recover, because even if the general improvement in quality continues, it doesn’t have enough remaining installments to become worthwhile as a whole.</p></div></div></section>
