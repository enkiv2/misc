It’s a great city to work in, but that doesn’t do it for me. If you could make the city the best in the country it would be a fantastic city — but it’s not. We spend more time with the people here, the people who are here in Scotland, so in some ways we’re like them.</p><p name="ee00" id="ee00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I come from the south of England and I’ve always hated coming into Glasgow. I come from an area where the city is pretty big and it’s a great city on the south coast. At home we only have two or three shops and I was born and raised in one of those tiny shops. So all I have really ever done is travel and experience things and it comes out very well in the movies, in TV, for example.</p><p name="7128" id="7128" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s one of the best places to work, the most incredible city, but, you know, I’m just going to say it, I never really wanted the job at all.</p><p name="84c5" id="84c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What are your biggest weaknesses?<br></strong>If I’m not being honest, we have a weakness with a lot of things. I would say that our health and our fitness were a little bit down last year — it comes with the territory.</p><p name="d384" id="d384" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It comes with the territory of being a team, and we really didn’t have that a lot of times. That was also really a team thing. Even though we had good moments and good performances, I think I had a little bit of a slow start.</p><p name="a902" id="a902" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think it started with that summer. After the offseason, which was a big one, I think the team became healthier a little bit. I think we really needed a better summer, or maybe even a shorter one, so it felt like we were trying to get better.</p><p name="db18" id="db18" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think that, this summer, I feel like I’m making more progress and being more consistent and being in better shape, and I think it’s been the case a little bit. It’s only just now in July that I feel like I’m in a better place.</p><p name="e7ef" id="e7ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You had great chemistry together.</p><p name="3716" id="3716" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What are your biggest strengths?</strong> How would you describe yourself to a potential employer?</p><p name="4359" id="4359" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">SV: I’ve been fortunate to work in many industries including fashion design, video gaming, and social media. I’ve worked at many different companies where I have found a good fit with the team where I reside. I’ve worked in every aspect of the industry, whether it be fashion, graphic design, or marketing, I enjoy working with the people who contribute to the brand and helping customers understand its vision. In that time my favorite thing to do has always been meeting the customers and making them proud.</p><p name="b652" id="b652" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What’s your weakness? What do you struggle with most?</p><p name="9ce5" id="9ce5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">SB: I’m definitely an optimist, I like to believe that things can always work out and that no matter how hard you work you can always learn things from your situation.</p><p name="6f78" id="6f78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you were a godlike being, what would you be like to work for and why?</p><p name="2241" id="2241" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">SB: Most of us think we could become something great, but how good is it and do we actually want it?</p><p name="79b5" id="79b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Where do you see yourself in five years?</strong></p><p name="af0e" id="af0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have no idea. I don’t like to look. I have no idea what will happen in five years. But I’m certainly going to keep doing new music for our new album because I really feel that we’re in a place in the world and people are changing all the time.</p><p name="bfe5" id="bfe5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How much pressure do you put on yourself at all times?</p><p name="51fd" id="51fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s the music that’s being made up in the moment. Sometimes I worry about things. Sometimes I go out and have fun with people. I don’t want to be too concerned about things. I try to be a little more concerned with what’s happening with music and the world I live in and what I’m doing and what that means to me. I don’t want to be too concerned because I feel like sometimes it’s important to see what’s happening on the outside. I feel like now we’re all in a position where we’re all more concerned with the outside world and we’re all looking at the same things and thinking about the same things.</p><p name="6677" id="6677" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Out of all the other candidates, why should we hire you?</strong></p><p name="7a11" id="7a11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As chief exec of a major tech provider, the person working on a product for a billion users is one who has a deep understanding of what is going on in the world of tech… and is very, very smart. We do think there will be a lot of interest in my skillset and experience, as well as those of a senior partner and manager of the Microsoft Office team — but that we need an established team of experience to help lead what we’re doing.</p><p name="2c49" id="2c49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’ve taken the time to learn both the software and business strategies that Microsoft is implementing with Office 365, and you have made the transition to Office 365 so seamless you don’t notice. As someone who has spent over 18 months on the road convincing your boss and your peers (including a couple of the people at the top, like VP Products) that this was a good idea to launch Office 365 alongside all of your other programs, and you’ve spent the summer running office space and hiring an amazing team of Office 365 experts, have you made the transition to Office 365 that smooth for you?</p><p name="06c8" id="06c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How did you learn about the opening?</strong></p><p name="38e5" id="38e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had a lot of questions.</p><p name="a84d" id="a84d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How do you view the relationship between the two of these guys?</p><p name="c83f" id="c83f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m a huge fan of the work they’ve done for years now. I’m happy that they are in the position and the company they are. That makes it the perfect place for them.</p><p name="3cff" id="3cff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s been a wild ride, hasn’t it?</p><p name="3026" id="3026" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I never thought I would be here, and it’s a different place than I knew. I was happy at Universal, but this is just another ride. I can’t wait for it to stop.</p><p name="a087" id="a087" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why do you want this job?</strong> I’m your manager.” I think his idea was to make up to me a little piece so that I would hire him, that maybe he’d have a better shot at getting hired. He said: “Okay, I’ll give you the job.” But that’s not how it went. I’ve always, from the very very beginning, been an honest, straight-forward journalist, doing my job and giving it to what I thought was the right person.</p><p name="fe2c" id="fe2c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Did you know about the affair until long after you had the job? Yes, we had a long conversation about it, and I was very upset and embarrassed to find out I had taken it on with someone else. It was just a matter of me trying to figure out what was wrong. Of course, it’s quite hard for a man to know that a woman wants to be with him but he also hasn’t found anyone suitable. It turns out that that is really difficult for a lot of men to see.</p><p name="5c39" id="5c39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Did you talk to Robert about the affair? Yes, I talked to him.</p><p name="f14e" id="f14e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What do you consider your biggest professional achievement?</strong></p><p name="26d8" id="26d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve always been very passionate about giving back to the community that made me in this industry, and it’s something I’ve tried to incorporate into my day. My first real job out of college was for a non-profit group that helped connect people with resources for mental health, and that gave me a tremendous amount of confidence in myself and the talent I have for helping people. I ended up working at a really wonderful facility in Los Angeles, and I got to create a beautiful office for a group of people that was working to get their voices heard and bring awareness to the issue, with the support of a great team and an amazing team of staff that have been with me throughout this journey. They got me out of school in my last semester and into something I really cared about, which is helping my fellow humanity and I’m still going to be there for as long as possible. I just hope to continue making a substantial impact on people’s lives and I want to continue to be a resource to the people that I can’t get to every day.</p><p name="93f1" id="93f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Tell me about the last time a co-worker or customer got angry with you. What happened?</strong></p><p name="46c8" id="46c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A: When I was a teacher, the school fired me. I wasn’t fired. I was fired for being too friendly to the students. I never touched their desks. I let the students talk to me. No one ever came to my defense. I was never interviewed.</p><p name="e6d5" id="e6d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Q: Do you feel your behavior toward customers is consistent with your profession?</p><p name="5998" id="5998" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A: I’ve always had a way of doing things. As an educator, that’s how I’ve been trained. It doesn’t matter if I’ve had a few drinks. I’ve made the same mistakes in the past. It’s not what anyone would expect from you as a lawyer. I know people who have been fired from this profession because of misconduct. I’ve learned not to repeat that mistake.</p><p name="bd94" id="bd94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Q: How does the bar industry view you and how might they view you?</p><p name="3475" id="3475" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A: I have no respect for any institution of higher learning. I am an independent contractor. They have nothing to do with my legal practice unless I do a great job.</p><p name="97a8" id="97a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Describe your dream job.</strong></p><p name="e234" id="e234" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Make sure you are getting a good one.</p><p name="0586" id="0586" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do not give up until you achieve your dream.</p><p name="edb4" id="edb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you get stuck in the dream job, get others to give positive feedback.</p><p name="6cd8" id="6cd8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you get stuck at the job itself, try to explain to the hiring manager that you are not suitable for the job, so that he/she will change to you.</p><p name="8425" id="8425" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If your dream job doesn’t suit you or you decide to stay in your true dream job, then go for something that better suits you and your interests.</p><p name="8be8" id="8be8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What do you mean by: “I’m going to be rich?”</p><p name="9d42" id="9d42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a good idea to be honest. If your dream job is going to take you away from all your friends and loved ones, it is time to quit.</p><p name="5727" id="5727" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can easily do that by just quitting your dream job.</p><p name="2565" id="2565" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you will not quit any time soon, then think again, that you’ve done the hard work for the past decade.</p><p name="2f13" id="2f13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So stop dreaming, stop working and you’ll never get rich.</p><p name="7f15" id="7f15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why do you want to leave your current job?</strong></p><p name="7266" id="7266" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wish to move onto another role — what I can do to help?</p><p name="82cc" id="82cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m considering leaving my current employer.

I had voted to keep the detention center open because it would help us secure our borders. At the time the Bush Administration was making a major push for that — they were calling it Operation Gatekeeper — and they said we couldn’t keep people there for any longer with some of the information that was being created, and that would be the last place we would want to keep our people. They would be safe in other places, where the United States did have a commitment to keeping them. A few days before the vote on this vote, the General Accounting Office called our office to say that there had been significant increases in prisoners being transferred to the island, and there were significant gains in the ability of detainees to move around, and to change their identities. In other words, this country was allowing people’s rights to get out of line, as if the American people were a bunch of idiots who weren’t smart enough to know that when I was born there was an agreement that</p><p name="9153" id="9153" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is your leadership style?</strong></p><p name="add0" id="add0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I like to say that I am a team player.

I believe that it is only with this type of opportunity that the brand can grow, which is why I am always looking for other ways to engage with my audience and engage them.</p><p name="95d8" id="95d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What do you do to maintain your brand recognition?</p><p name="114b" id="114b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I keep the brand as fresh in mind as possible, so that by the time someone is looking at the brand, I want them to think it is fresh when they see</p><p name="3708" id="3708" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What do you like to do outside of work?</strong></p><p name="86f4" id="86f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m a gamer and a gamer girl so I do a lot of video games. I love to dance and I like to dance to music. So that sort of things. Anything to do with computers and games.</p><p name="49c4" id="49c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What is your least favorite game?</p><p name="1a4e" id="1a4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s the hard one to answer because you know, they do keep coming up so many times. I think I have the least favorite. You’ll find some great titles, like Minecraft and it’s absolutely one of my favorites that I always put time into. One of the greatest games to date is that you get to be in the game and I just love that and it’s really awesome to me. I’m not an expert in the game itself but it was quite the experience.</p><p name="7e07" id="7e07" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the others… [Laughs] I don’t even like them. I think it’s a little bit too much. I think some of them are just too hard.</p><p name="398e" id="398e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What game would you like to see at PAX Prime?</p><p name="6da6" id="6da6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think right now it would be Dragon Age II</p><p name="f949" id="f949" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What was your salary in your last job?</strong></p><p name="5c16" id="5c16" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I started off at $7.25 an hour, and then after my first month went from $7.25 to $15 an hour.</p><p name="eed3" id="eed3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What did it take to get the job?</p><p name="4b18" id="4b18" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I did it with a lot of hard work, but when I found the job, it was not good pay.</p><p name="87d9" id="87d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What was the worst part?</p><p name="64d2" id="64d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was put on a paid weekend shift. I think it was a lot of overtime. And I had to stand at the kitchen counter, which is a very good job, but a miserable job.</p><p name="ecbc" id="ecbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why?</p><p name="4e35" id="4e35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was working 10 hours a day and was not allowed to relax.

I had to be there all the time just to keep up to speed with her.

How many days will it take him to climb out of the well?</strong></p><p name="c4a1" id="c4a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Each day we observe two snails. We put the snail in a box with his burrows. We also put a piece of paper on top of the box, and we put an apple to get him to eat. If he tries to eat the paper we have to put him back in the well. If that’s too much, we put a small piece of bread in the box, so the snail eats it. We take him out of the box and put him where he can climb, then we repeat every day until he gets the hang of climbing up the walls of his burrows and he starts climbing up the walls of his well.</p><p name="042e" id="042e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The other day he climbs up, grabs one of the apple slices, and goes for an apple-basket. How far will he go out of the well before he falls in?</p><p name="6c1d" id="6c1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are two ways to put the snail in the well, but which is more effective?</p><p name="5776" id="5776" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What questions do you have for me?</strong></p><p name="f950" id="f950" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am going to assume you are a pretty nice human being and a fairly sophisticated web developer. You would probably not run such a request to me that way but that is the best way to get my thoughts.</p><p name="ba4d" id="ba4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You would probably want to verify that the data I provide is as I think it is (the answer is no, it is not), verify the integrity of the data I provide (it is not), and if you think the response is not sufficiently robust, verify some additional data.</p><p name="4c29" id="4c29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you already have a valid source you should have no problem with that. Also, please know that your request is just as valid as mine, you just asked for something more detailed in the form of a list of attributes to verify.</p><p name="d595" id="d595" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you have a few questions (anything that doesn’t fall into the above categories), I would be happy to answer them as well. Also, please know that my answers are only as accurate as I am able to provide them. My time is limited and I cannot respond to comments with replies.</p><p name="a896" id="a896" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thanks.</p><p name="c37a" id="c37a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What do you expect me to accomplish in the first 90 days?</strong></p><p name="662d" id="662d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’ve already been doing that.</p><p name="5f8c" id="5f8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’ve already done exactly the same thing. You may have even been an asshole in the process. We didn’t know each other when we were first in the house. Some of us were still friends, some we barely knew, some we didn’t care enough to invite over for coffee as friends. I’d just be sitting there waiting to be invited. That was how it was before I came over to the house to live. The people I worked with had a few relationships that they had with each other at the time, but we had few people like me. I was the new kid and would sit there and watch. We would make a lot of jokes about how I was different, but we’d mostly just be laughing as they would run around getting dirty and getting into everything. I wasn’t in school at the time.</p><p name="d354" id="d354" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then came the “happiness-quotient.” Now, it wasn’t the same as being happy.

You never need to see an injury on film to get a solid read on a player if he is smart and well-prepared. They’ll be the ones looking after your back and doing everything. If they are a good defensive player but not the most gifted in the passing game, they will probably get the first shot when you’re on the verge of losing a game.”</p><p name="fb5b" id="fb5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do you see the team growing?</p><p name="70b3" id="70b3" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I think it will grow. I think it will be harder. It will be more intense. There will be more of a physical edge to our play. This was a good year to get out of the playoffs — maybe even a cup — because the teams were really good. But the playoffs aren’t as good as you think. We still have a chance to turn it around. I think that our fans and the people within the game see a team that is better than some teams in the West.”</p><p name="03ed" id="03ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What really drives results in this job?</strong></p><p name="6cdc" id="6cdc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We work, and work we did, with the help of our mentors — a group of people working on an actual project in the lab. We know the work we do, and we use the best of what we are doing to bring out what we do best. I think that the ability to see what can/should have been done better and why, and then to implement those lessons to the software that you are using today, is one of the most important things. This knowledge can’t be taught at a university, but it can be learned — and often through many steps in the process.</p><p name="895b" id="895b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you are not an engineer, your best tool in this process may be your intuition. Some people have much more knowledge on this area than others — what is it that you do with your intuition? What do you see in the software that you do not see. It may be that you are able to see certain problems in the software in new or different ways that other people cannot. Often this knowledge comes with years of experience. Sometimes this information can be gained in a matter</p><p name="5546" id="5546" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What are the company’s highest-priority goals this year, and how would my role contribute?</strong></p><p name="fa35" id="fa35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I spend much of my time on the business side focused on the operational side of the business. It’s no secret that the product is the single most important aspect of a company, both for the success of an application and its long-term sustainability. The product makes decisions that impact customers, increase productivity, reduce costs, and change how things are being delivered. The team spends a lot of time working on features, improving the product’s user experience, and improving its processes.</p><p name="497d" id="497d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have a personal belief that we don’t build companies to make a profit, and that we build them to improve the people and the world around them. Every company has high-end executives with an appetite to go beyond profit, but they know best what the right way to make money is. I would want to be one of those high-end executives.</p><p name="5647" id="5647" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What would the company’s main challenge in 2012 be?</p><p name="eeef" id="eeef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first thing is to execute our goal(s) to produce at the levels we’ve agreed to commit to.

This is not done for small companies, this is done for larger, professional companies.</p><p name="b382" id="b382" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How many employees is the organisation?</p><p name="638b" id="638b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The answer to this question is important for organisations. Companies are required to be able to calculate the numbers of members based on the number of employees, which allows you to determine how large a organisation is. In terms of numbers of employees, a large company is one with more than 3,000 employees (a large company is defined as with more than 5,000 employees), a small company or one with fewer than 50 people is one with less than 2,000 employees.</p><p name="4d55" id="4d55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What do you plan to do if </strong>_____ ends up in this place?</p><p name="4cf5" id="4cf5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you want to protect someone who can’t help themselves, it has to be by putting your whole heart into it. In my experience, as hard as it is to speak that way, the most important thing is that you’re honest about it, or you won’t get very far. I used to say to some people I was “pissed off.” They weren’t listening, so I said, “I am really pissed off about _____.” It stuck with me until people stopped asking me that question. I was talking about my mother at the time, and she was crying the whole time. She didn’t want me to say it was about her, but she was, I knew it was her last day. I went to the car, put on a smile, and walked home. This goes along with what I mentioned above: being honest with yourself and with others.</p><p name="f1dc" id="f1dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do you think that what people are saying about you is based on what you say and say about yourself?</p><p name="6bcf" id="6bcf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I would argue that it</p></div></div></section>
