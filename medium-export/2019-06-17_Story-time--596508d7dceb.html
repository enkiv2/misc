We now call it ‘AJAX’, but it’s the same thing: using javascript to rewrite HTML in real time. This is because the web browser is, essentially, a rich text viewer (like a copy of microsoft word where you can’t edit documents), but with a programming language embedded (like word’s macro system), &amp; people were put under pressure to make web pages act more like whole applications. But, it turned out that you could do funny things like post a comment that loaded new javascript from your own website that, for instance, replaced the login form with a new login form that sent passwords to you. This is called a cross-site scripting attack. So, because nobody thinks ahead, browser makers created a ‘solution’ called Same Origin Policy (SOP). SOP, in a nutshell, means “it’s impossible for code running on a website to download things from a website with a different domain name”.</p><p name="1b3a" id="1b3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a stupid solution for many reasons: it doesn’t actually solve the problem sometimes, and it causes a bunch of other problems.</p><p name="af47" id="af47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the problems it causes is that when somebody’s medium publication (or tumblr blog, or whatever) has its own domain name, suddenly every piece of javascript that deals with site-wide stuff (like cookies, or accounts, or whatever) doesn’t work.</p><p name="2df3" id="2df3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">How they get around this is to actually have the login screen be available through this other domain, and make everybody re-log-in. It’s not a duplicate account, because magenta.as and hackernoon.com and all these other things are actually not different websites — they’re just alternate domains pointing at medium, which medium has been instructed to treat in special ways — but you’ll have a duplicate cookie on your computer, because basically all of our infrastructure assumes that a single domain = a single owner = a single server = a single account.</p></div></div></section>
