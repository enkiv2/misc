Is this at least the equivalent of a new 500-page paperback per month? (A good one, I mean — not the kind where you buy it and then grudgingly finish it because you don’t want to have wasted $5. A new Neal Stephenson novel or something.)</p><p name="6a6b" id="6a6b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">High quality print magazines charge about $5 a month, and when they don’t deliver, they lose readers. High quality print magazines have utility separate from their actual content: they can be used to swat flies or line bird cages, which a Medium subscription cannot. At the very least, in order for Medium to be worthwhile, it must be superior to all the high-quality print magazines to which you subscribe (and all the similarly priced magazines to which you don’t subscribe because of their poor quality).</p><p name="0aeb" id="0aeb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">$5 is not like one cup of coffee a month. $5 is like choosing to splurge on expensive cafe-brewed coffee once a month; you can make several months of coffee in your home coffee maker with $5 worth of beans. Does Medium deliver enough to satisfy the crowd that would rather get beans in bulk and have many months of cheap coffee they must prepare themselves than purchase expensive chain coffee?</p><p name="65f3" id="65f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What Medium is charging is about half of what Netflix charges me. I watch a lot of Netflix. I would expect to get at least half the enjoyment I get out of Netflix out of Medium’s premium content in order to make the subscription fee worthwhile.</p><p name="c894" id="c894" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">This is a pretty high bar. Does it deliver?</p></div></div></section>
