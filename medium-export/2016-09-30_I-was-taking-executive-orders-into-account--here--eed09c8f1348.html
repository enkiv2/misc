One of these is a highly efficient and effective administrator whose desire for power and recognition drives her behavior in very predictable ways, and who can easily be manipulated into effectively administering the country in ways that are desirable if minor. The other has behaviors that cannot be influenced or predicted, but, luckily, he’s never been terribly effective at giving orders or convincing people to do things, so to the extent that he is likely to make sweeping changes, it will be in completely arbitrary, unpredictable ways.</p></div></div></section>
