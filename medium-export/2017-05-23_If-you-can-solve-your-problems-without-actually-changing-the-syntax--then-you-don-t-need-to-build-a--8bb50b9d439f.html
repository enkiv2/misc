Writing a DSL may also reduce pain points incrementally in a way that prevents you from making much greater strides with syntax changes (in the same way that Zizek suggests the existence of charity prevents people from being serious about reform).</p><p name="c18c" id="c18c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If a DSL is really enough, then that’s fine. But, if you’re considering actually writing a language, think carefully about whether or not a vastly different syntax would be better. If a DSL reduces the problem by 20% and a new language reduces it by 80%, a new language is justifed.</p><p name="f894" id="f894" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I absolutely condone writing interpreted languages in other interpreted languages. Doing so saves a lot of early development effort. A well-designed language can always be reimplemented in a faster way later (while a poorly-designed language is going to be very difficult to make even small optimizations for).</p></div></div></section>
