The original sources tend to be extremely repetitive, prone to inserting long lists, and without a strong narrative.</p><p name="9906" id="9906" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of this is the use of exhaustive lists of epithets. For instance, here is a portion of an actual myth:</p><pre name="108e" id="108e" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">Grandiloquent lord of heaven and earth, self-reliant, Father Enki, engendered by a bull, begotten by a wild bull, cherished by Enlil, the Great Mountain, beloved by holy An, king, <em class="markup--em markup--pre-em">meš</em> tree planted in the Abzu, rising over all lands; great dragon who stands in Eridug, whose shadow covers heaven and earth, a grove of vines extending over the Land, Enki, lord of plenty of the Anuna gods, Nudimmud, mighty one of the E-kur, strong one of heaven and earth! Your great house is founded in the Abzu, the great mooring-post of heaven and earth. Enki, from whom a single glance is enough to unsettle the heart of the mountains; wherever bison are born, where stags are born, where ibex are born, where wild goats are born, in meadows ……, in hollows in the heart of the hills, in green …… unvisited by man, you have fixed your gaze on the heart of the Land as on split reeds.</pre><p name="869d" id="869d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre">About eighty percent of that paragraph is a list of alternate names for or attributes of the god Enki. Only the final line, “you have fixed your gaze on the heart of the Land as on split reeds”, is action — and the action in question is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">looking down</em>.</p><p name="d487" id="d487" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Other times, the author suddenly descends into exhaustive lists of types of things, as with this section, where he lists musical instruments:</p><pre name="836a" id="836a" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">&quot;He made {the lyre, the <em class="markup--em markup--pre-em">alĝar</em> instrument, the <em class="markup--em markup--pre-em">balaĝ</em> drum with the drumsticks} {(<em class="markup--em markup--pre-em">some mss. have instead:</em>) the lyre, the <em class="markup--em markup--pre-em">alĝar</em> instrument, the <em class="markup--em markup--pre-em">balaĝ</em> drum of your <em class="markup--em markup--pre-em">sur</em> priests} {(<em class="markup--em markup--pre-em">1 ms. has instead:</em>) your lyre and <em class="markup--em markup--pre-em">alĝar</em> instrument, the <em class="markup--em markup--pre-em">balaĝ</em> drum with the drumsticks} {(<em class="markup--em markup--pre-em">1 ms. has instead:</em>) the lyre, the <em class="markup--em markup--pre-em">alĝar</em>instrument, the <em class="markup--em markup--pre-em">balaĝ</em> drum and even the plectrum (?)}, the <em class="markup--em markup--pre-em">ḫarḫar</em>, the <em class="markup--em markup--pre-em">sabitum</em>, and the …… <em class="markup--em markup--pre-em">miritum</em>instruments offer their best for his holy temple. The …… resounded by themselves with a sweet sound. The holy <em class="markup--em markup--pre-em">alĝar</em> instrument of Enki played for him on his own and seven {singers sang} {(<em class="markup--em markup--pre-em">some mss. have instead:</em>) <em class="markup--em markup--pre-em">tigi</em> drums resounded.}&quot;</pre><p name="5f1b" id="5f1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre">The inclusion of editorial notes indicating variations between sources expands this further. (This pattern probably has something to do with the style in which scribes were educated: they spent much of their time transcribing lists of related objects or animals read aloud by a teacher, then later transcribed myths read aloud.)</p><p name="c014" id="c014" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The style in which sumerian gods are usually named is also well-fitted to generation. Usually, their name is a combination of the word for their general domain and either ‘en’ or ‘nin’ (both of which mean ‘lord’ or ‘master’). Generally speaking, there is also some drift, as gods have their domains overlap with others in the pantheon &amp; take on some of the same epithets. (For instance, Enki, whose domain is water &amp; creativity, is strongly associated with the manufacture of alcoholic beverages, even though that domain is properly owned by Ninkashi — ‘our lady of drinks’.)</p><p name="6f58" id="6f58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Taking inspiration from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=narjui3em1k" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=narjui3em1k" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the use of categorized corpora in Emily Short’s Annals of the Perrigues</a>, I created <a href="https://github.com/enkiv2/misc/blob/268c9e98866ddac7035e8a0a90ca54032b46c973/junogenmo-2018/sumerian.py#L8" data-href="https://github.com/enkiv2/misc/blob/268c9e98866ddac7035e8a0a90ca54032b46c973/junogenmo-2018/sumerian.py#L8" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lists of specific domains associated with sumerian words</a>, then produced <a href="https://github.com/enkiv2/misc/blob/268c9e98866ddac7035e8a0a90ca54032b46c973/junogenmo-2018/sumerian.py#L25" data-href="https://github.com/enkiv2/misc/blob/268c9e98866ddac7035e8a0a90ca54032b46c973/junogenmo-2018/sumerian.py#L25" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lists of epithets associated with those domains</a>.

Actual sumerian myths are often fairly narratively simple (when they aren’t overly repetitive and complex), and so I turned the plots of some actual myths into templates:</p><pre name="8f73" id="8f73" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">storyTemplates=[ <br>    &quot;%a% went to the market in %city%. There were %band% %a% met %b%.&quot;,  <br>    &quot;%a% was sitting on a throne.

So, %b% and %a% made another bet, and %a% won again. Finally, %b% removed all their clothes and seduced %a%, who gave up their winnings, and %b% left on a magic boat&quot;, <br>    &quot;%a% was sad. %b% said, \&quot;%a%, why are you crying?\&quot; %a% didn&#39;t respond. %b% said, \&quot;%a%, my %a%, why do you cry?

The musical instruments found in sumerian records are often difficult to categorize or describe, since the names used bear no relationship to more modern names with which we have more complete records associated. (This is a common problem with sumerian taxonomies of things — it’s a long-dead language that was completely lost &amp; forgotten for thousands of years, and one in which long lists of names were more common than descriptions. There are lots of plant and animal lists that are similarly obscure.) As a result, I simply generate gibberish names — as meaningful, in most cases, to a scholar of the ancient near east as actual sumerian musical instrument names:</p><pre name="15d1" id="15d1" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">def musicalInstrumentName(): <br>    return (  <br>        random.choice([&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;&quot;])+  <br>        random.choice([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;u&quot;])+<br>        random.choice([&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;&quot;])+  <br>        random.choice([&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;&quot;])+  <br>        random.choice([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;u&quot;])+  random.choice([&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;&quot;])+  <br>        &quot; &quot;+random.choice([&quot;drums&quot;, &quot;lutes&quot;, &quot;flutes&quot;, &quot;whistles&quot;, &quot;reeds&quot;, &quot;birds&quot;, &quot;singers&quot;, &quot;lamentation singers&quot;]))</pre><p name="facd" id="facd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre">Finally, I produce titles, based on the common format found in actual titles:</p><pre name="ec03" id="ec03" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">storyNames=[ <br>    &quot;The lamentation of %a%&quot;, <br>    &quot;The lamentation of %a% in %city%&quot;, <br>    &quot;%a% and %b%&quot;, &quot;%a% and %b% in %city%&quot;, <br>    &quot;%a% and the lord of %city%&quot;, <br>    &quot;%a% and the priest of %b%&quot;<br>]</pre><p name="6178" id="6178" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre">The results aren’t exactly readable, but they are almost precisely as readable as the sumerian myths themselves.</p><pre name="a6d9" id="a6d9" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">LILNIN AND ENKASHI</pre><pre name="f3f0" id="f3f0" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre">Ninki, <br> [14 ms have: , <br> beloved Ninki, <br> [22 ms have: , <br> whose dung-heaps are the mountains, <br> whose excrement fertilizes the fields, <br> beloved Ninki, <br> whose excrement fertilizes the fields, <br> [22 ms have: , <br> beloved Ninki, <br> [11 ms have: , <br> whose advice is always advisable, <br> beloved Ninki, <br> whose excrement fertilizes the fields, <br> beloved Ninki, <br> whose domain is the earth, <br> whose domain is the land, <br> who sets the nations and draws their borders, <br> whose plow-furroughs are the valleys, <br> whose domain is the earth, <br> beloved Ninki, <br> whose dung-heaps are the mountains, <br> whose domain is the earth, <br> whose domain is the land, <br> whose advice is always advisable, <br> whose domain is the earth, <br> whose dung-heaps are the mountains, <br> beloved Ninki, <br> whose dung-heaps are the mountains, <br> beloved Ninki, <br> whose hands build the mountains and topple them, <br> who puts the continents in their places, <br> who puts the continents in their places<br> was sad.
