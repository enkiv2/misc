I feel blessed by the awesome folks who argue about computers with me on mastodon.</p><p name="16c9" id="16c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first thread is longer and has more drift, but it’s worth digging through, because it’s mostly a meditation on what kind of language we might want (what kind of facilities and attributes we might want) for small computing (i.e., for exploration, prototyping, and a composition-friendly general computing environment).</p><p name="4e52" id="4e52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My take on it is that we want:<br>1) homogeneity — all mechanisms should be in the same language and be equally easy to edit (rather than having distinct domains like compiled c programs vs shell scripts, or having separate privilege levels like kernel vs user space); because this is a small-computing environment, neither security nor performance should take priority over flexibility<br>2) support for an agglutanative / syntax-lite style — the need to produce boilerplate &amp; declarations, explicit types, and any constraints that require conceptually similar things to be visually very different all get in the way of iteration, while the likes of lisp, forth, rebol, bourne-style shells, APL, and io all present a style more well-suited to long-term iteration on a persistent interactive REPL-like environment<br>3) both function-like, message-like, and pipe-like code composition — different kinds of data flows and different kind of modularization have different patterns of behavior that are convenient for them<br>4) backtracking and pattern matching as a built-in facility — constraint programming is rare as a feature in imperative-style languages, but a declarative style is a very powerful tool for rapid iteration, because it means that not-yet-implemented code can literally run so long as the requirements for that code are well-defined</p><p name="5c04" id="5c04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">In the second thread, the idea of system- or vm-level backtracking exposed as both a mechanism for capabilities-based security and fast constraint solving in user code is explored. My take is:<br>1) if we combine copy-on-write with the parallelism supported by the underlying host system, we can get fast and easy constraint solving for the whole system<br>2) this is completely compatible with global forking undo on the vm level<br>3) it can be conveniently implemented in terms of a journal and a vm image</p></div></div></section>
