Salon parties &amp; coffee houses also catered to this use case, and it seems like coffee houses would cultivate social groups and bring in events like scientific demonstrations &amp; political speeches during the nineteenth century, as a means of drawing a crowd some of whom would purchase coffee, the same way that bars will occasionally bring in gratis musical acts. By the 1960s, at least from the perspective of europeans, these spaces were already gone or commercialized: the concept of a shopping mall was created specifically to produce european-style public spaces in the united states, with shops and commerce being in the original conception an unimportant side-effect &amp; features like benches, squares, and food courts being more central. (Of course, shopping malls essentially suffered through a very long bubble, as a result of real estate loopholes; they were everywhere and extremely commercialized up through the early 90s, at which point they started going out of business.)</p><p name="527e" id="527e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The best idea I can think of for bringing back public spaces is to expand &amp; publicize the low-key social spaces that already exist in or associated with libraries: libraries are already indoors, and they already essentially deal with people, but most social spaces in libraries in my experience are exclusive &amp; by reservation only; with good sound-proofing &amp; clever layout, social spaces &amp; quiet spaces within a library can be segregated and the kind of free-wheeling nineteenth-century-coffee-house experience can be reconstructed to some extent.</p></div></div></section>
