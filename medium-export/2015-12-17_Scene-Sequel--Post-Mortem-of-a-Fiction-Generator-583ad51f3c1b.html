The same kind of planning used in <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/~winograd/shrdlu/" data-href="http://hci.stanford.edu/~winograd/shrdlu/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SHRDLU (Winograd, 1972)</a> drove early planner-based fiction generators like <a href="http://eliterature.org/2006/01/meehan-and-sacks-micro-talespin/" data-href="http://eliterature.org/2006/01/meehan-and-sacks-micro-talespin/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TALE-SPIN (Meehan, 1976)</a>. This class of fiction generators is a middle ground between ‘simulationist’ models, wherein a large number of variables are modeled carefully and a story is extracted from the progression between states by dropping most of the information modelled, and ‘texture’ models, wherein large pieces of preexisting flavor text are pieced together. (An example of the former would be the history of the world produced by <a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Legends" data-href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Legends" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dwarf Fortress</a>, and an example of the latter would be <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/28/news/mn-35062" data-href="http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/28/news/mn-35062" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BRUTUS (Bringsjord, 2000)</a>.) TALE-SPIN-like planner-based fiction generators have, historically, like TALE-SPIN, modeled a set of characters and modeled their interactions. The most interesting stories generated by these generators remain the “mis-spun tales”, wherein assumptions by the generator are flawed in a way that produces absurd violations of common sense; the remainder of tales are fairly mundane transcripts of interactions between characters. As demonstrations of a functional model, these transcripts are serviceable; as stories, they lack interesting forms of structured conflict.</p><p name="a85d" id="a85d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Author Jim Butcher presents a model of plot construction I call the ‘<a href="http://jimbutcher.livejournal.com/2647.html" data-href="http://jimbutcher.livejournal.com/2647.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">scene</a>-<a href="http://jimbutcher.livejournal.com/2880.html" data-href="http://jimbutcher.livejournal.com/2880.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sequel</a> model’ that diverges from the idea of the world as a perfect simulation and focuses on the kinds of stories readers find interesting. While Butcher’s interest is in human-written stories, his ideas <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015/issues/155" data-href="https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015/issues/155" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lend themselves</a> to generative fiction more so than other seemingly more mechanical models of plot construction like <a href="https://archive.org/stream/plottonewmethodo00cook#page/n3/mode/2up" data-href="https://archive.org/stream/plottonewmethodo00cook#page/n3/mode/2up" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Plotto</a> and the <a href="http://www.savethecat.com/tools/the-blake-snyder-beat-sheet-the-bs2" data-href="http://www.savethecat.com/tools/the-blake-snyder-beat-sheet-the-bs2" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BS2</a>. Quickly: within the scene-sequel model, a story has a single protagonist and consists of scenes (wherein the protagonist attempts to achieve his or her goal) and sequels (wherein the protagonist reacts to the content of the scene emotionally and performs his or her planning); scenes have scene-specific goals that are either achieved or not achieved and each scene may introduce complications that change the protagonist’s state.</p><p name="c7ad" id="c7ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Current work</strong><br>For <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015" data-href="https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NaNoGenMo 2015</a>, I present a <a href="https://github.com/enkiv2/scene-sequel" data-href="https://github.com/enkiv2/scene-sequel" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fiction generator</a> based on a simplified scene-sequel model for caper novels. In this model, there is only one character modeled: the protagonist, who is also the narrator. The content of the story is generated by the planner with the help of flavor text.</p><p name="48de" id="48de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The story is generated by the planner from a ‘world model’, which is a state machine with associated flavor text. The world model consists of a list of state objects; each state object has a list of other states it can transition to (along with a probability for this transition to occur and optional flavor text for describing attempted, successful, and failed transitions). It furthermore contains a set of potential complications, which themselves are state names paired with probabilities.</p><p name="08d2" id="08d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The planner is provided with a world model, a weight for state transition success rate, a weight for complication accretion rate, a starting state, and a goal state. The planner keeps a ‘goal pool’ consisting of a set of state names and weights, and this goal pool is initially set to the goal state. Typically, the goal state is the overarching goal of the protagonist. As complications are accrued, they are added to the goal pool.</p><p name="8c76" id="8c76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At each step, we perform a sequel followed by a scene.</p><p name="8197" id="8197" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The sequel consists of information produced by the planner, which (starting from the current state) performs a walk of the state space, depth-first, searching for the goal state. Because the world object contains cycles, the tree-walking portion of the planner is provided with a recursion depth limit. The planner, multiplying and adding probabilities, determines the immediate next state with the greatest composite likelihood of reaching each state in the goal pool — in other words, the likelihood of reaching each goal is determined, adjusted by its goal weight, and then a composite is produced for ranking purposes. During this tree-walking and goal-weighing process, at an adjustable rate, information about the planning process and the decisions being made is emitted in the style of first-person narration of planning in a caper novel:</p><blockquote name="d2a7" id="d2a7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">So, I thought, what if I tried to steal them jewels by trying to get a museum uniform… So, I thought, what if I tried to steal them jewels by trying to pass as a museum employee… So, I thought, what if I tried to steal them jewels by trying to go to the hospital… I’ll try to remember that.</blockquote><blockquote name="110c" id="110c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">So, I figured, if I tried to steal them jewels by trying to pass as a museum employee I’d have maybe a 35% chance of succeding.
