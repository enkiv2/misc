The actual cost of business is peanuts compared to the financial bukkake going on above (and the max amount of money they could make from ‘monetization’ like ads or subscriptions isn’t enough orders of magnitude bigger than the cost either), so businesses get subsidized so long as they’re trendy.</p><p name="a5b9" id="a5b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The other catch in this is that VCs are all sixty-something former hippies who haven’t noticed that Mark Zuckerberg is unpopular yet.</p><p name="be89" id="be89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">In other words: in any VC-backed business, its survival depends upon looking trendy to people whose idea of what’s trendy is between ten and fifteen years out of sync with the customer base.</p></div></div></section>
