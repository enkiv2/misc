I might be way off base, though.</p><p name="101f" id="101f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Medium’s particular chumbox is less offensive than outbrain/taboola, and tends to limit itself to mostly articles that genuinely will be interesting to people who read and were interested in the articles. As a result, I wonder if they’re doing something with recomendation-engine-style statistics; after all, they have not only view statistics but read statistics for all articles, not only tags but suggested tags (along with the training data they use to compute suggested tags from content), and full interaction graphs. They have all the information they need to get really excellent suggestion targetting, and (because there’s nothing remotely resembling monetization) there’s no real incentive for people to spend a lot of effort trying to game recommendations.</p></div></div></section>
