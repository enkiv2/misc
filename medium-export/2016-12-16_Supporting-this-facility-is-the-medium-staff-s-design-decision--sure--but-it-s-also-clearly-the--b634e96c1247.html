Allowing people to reccomend an article without at least scrolling to the end of it is not in line with these other decisions.</p><p name="2f35" id="2f35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I understand allowing people to recommend articles without registering a ‘read’ — Medium’s reading time estimates are often wildly inaccurate, and when I take five minutes to read something Medium expects to take twenty, I don’t want to wait another fifteen to click that heart. But, even if low-quality recommendations are allowed, we don’t need to cater to them.</p><p name="2dd7" id="2dd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Medium’s general quality seems to have dipped over time, with short, low-effort articles becoming more common or more often recommended. Titles have, in my experience, become more click-baity. Any mechanism that allows people to focus on an engagement metric less stringent than reading is likely to encourage this kind of decay (because, if you give somebody a number, they will do whatever it takes to maximize or minimize it).</p></div></div></section>
