It was an Arctek machine, top of the line perhaps half a decade ago, subtly modified and equipped with a sonic stunning device (nonfatal, but exceedingly unpleasant — developed for crowd control by the Argentinian equivalent of DARPA). “Identify yourself,” it said.</p><p name="6c84" id="6c84" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Dexter Logan. I’m here to see Tom.”</p><p name="8ecd" id="8ecd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The robot buzzed quietly for a moment, and Dex noticed that the Cicadas were out. “Dex!” The tone was familiar — a synthesized simulacrum.</p><p name="ef12" id="ef12" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Tom? Quit fucking around and call off the bot.”</p><p name="675a" id="675a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The robot swung its sonar apparatus smoothly back and forth, in a crude mimicry of a person shaking its head. “I’m not fuckin’ with you, Dex. It’s been a while. Ten minutes?”</p><p name="a529" id="a529" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Eleven,” Dex said.</p><p name="efff" id="efff" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Eleven candles candles,” the robot said. “Candles candles candles candles candles candles. Candles eleven of them.”</p><p name="d9cf" id="d9cf" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Fuck.” Tom’s a broken robot, thought Dex. Just then, a figure surfaced from within the long grass.</p><p name="4148" id="4148" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Dex, my man. Come with me.”</p><p name="702c" id="702c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dex followed Tom, and the robot trailed a few feet behind, still stuck in its verbal loop. “Some kind of fluke in my model traversal,” Tom said. “Fucker works just fine until suddenly it decides some word or phrase links to itself with a probability of one. Sometimes it matches my patterns enough to get registered as me, and then I have to go in and delete the bullshit from the database by hand.”</p><p name="a4ee" id="a4ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The farmhouse was small and old, but it offered shade from the unseasonably warm weather. The table was piled chest-high with second-hand junk. Scavenged robot chassis sat under it, sometimes on the floor and sometimes on chairs. The shaded lamp hanging from the ceiling had its power cable extracted, cut, joined with a pair of plastic caps, and cut again further down. Tom brought in a pair of stools from an adjoining room.</p><p name="b3dd" id="b3dd" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“It’s been a while. What, ten minutes?”</p><p name="b8cb" id="b8cb" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Eleven.”</p><p name="847b" id="847b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Eleven. What can I do for you?” He glanced at the cupboard. “A beer, maybe?”</p><p name="e9a8" id="e9a8" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I’m afraid this isn’t a social visit. I need your help.”</p><p name="efc2" id="efc2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tom got up abruptly. “I think I’m gonna need a beer, then.” He found a reasonably clean glass and cracked open a can of lukewarm beer, then settled down and took a long swig out of the can, not bothering to pour. “Okay, shoot.”</p><p name="42c0" id="42c0" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I got fucked over, Tom.” Dex sighed.</p><p name="72e7" id="72e7" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Infringement, again?”</p><p name="8fbd" id="8fbd" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Fuck no.” He grimaced. “Five minutes for that shit, and I wasn’t even doing it — just running the BBS. Staying straight now. Pen testing. Figured that was the way to go — using my skills but no chance of getting locked up.”</p><p name="036a" id="036a" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“So?”</p><p name="39c5" id="39c5" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“So, I think maybe I’ll need that beer after all.” While Tom got up, Dex took another look around. There were cameras and microphones everywhere. Through the crack in a half-opened door he glimpsed a bank of closed circuit television monitors. “You recording this shit, Tom?”</p><p name="3398" id="3398" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I record everything. Turns out that’s the only way to get believable responses.” He put a much cleaner glass down on an empty spot on the table and poured an equally warm beer into it. Dex looked at it as though it might contain more cameras.</p><p name="f29c" id="f29c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I did pen testing yesterday for Tim Dolby.”</p><p name="eb42" id="eb42" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The VP of Program Data?” Dex nodded. “But, yesterday…”</p><p name="8a06" id="8a06" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I know. There’s more.” Dex paused. “Whatever scam he’s pulling, he had me steal some files for him and fence them overseas.”</p><p name="f1d9" id="f1d9" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What files?”</p><p name="6691" id="6691" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I don’t know, man.” Dex took a swig of his beer. He got mostly hot foam. “I just know the filenames, and those were UUID. Base 64 shit.”</p><p name="b5f8" id="b5f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tom began fidgeting with his pen. A few minutes as cell mate had left Dex with an understanding of this man’s nervous habits, and he felt apprehension.</p><p name="2d3b" id="2d3b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“So a guy fakes his death, steals some files, frames you… And you run to me?” A whine crept into his voice. “You think I ain’t got enough problems as is?”</p><p name="daa8" id="daa8" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I covered my tracks as Most Unexceptional I could.”</p><p name="f58f" id="f58f" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Still–” he took a deep breath and calmed slightly. “Where overseas?”</p><p name="a1b8" id="a1b8" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The Caucuses.”</p><p name="64e9" id="64e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tom sighed. “You just got fuckin’ lucky, man.” Dex stared blankly. “What, haven’t been watching the news?” He took a device out of his pocket and flicked on a small CRT hidden amongst the bric-a-brac on the far side of the room.</p><p name="fbba" id="fbba" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing">“…IN THE CAUCUSES HAS HAD A MAJOR EFFECT ON OIL PRICES IN ADDITION TO OLYMPIC PLANS. THE UNITED NATIONS HAS SIGNED A DECLARATION TO SUPPORT THE REBELS AGAINST THE INTERIM…”</p></div></div></section>
