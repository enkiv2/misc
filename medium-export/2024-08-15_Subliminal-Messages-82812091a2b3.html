I’m a software engineer with a special interest, not a cognitive scientist or a neuroscientist or a behavioral economist or something, so if you are an expert and I got something wrong, let me know.</em></p><p name="5541" id="5541" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The popular image of subliminal messages as an irresistible technological super-hypnosis is (obviously) completely false. However, subliminal messages can exert influence in interesting ways.</p><p name="22d4" id="22d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are a few reasons why we know the ‘technological super-hypnosis’ thesis is false. One is empirical: the technology to do single frame cuts was pretty widely available, so this is an easy experiment to replicate, and it failed replication immediately. It owes its continued vitality to a lurid mass market paperback and its incurious readerbase, in a kind of Andrew Wakefield-esque series of events. Another reason is genealogical: this idea was modeled on the idea that hypnosis produced suggestibility by being a “direct line to the subconscious”, a super-powerful (often super-natural) domain of perfect memories and perfect naievety, easily corrupted and manipulated by cunning foreign invaders (the high-eyebrowed slavic-accented hypnotist with the ornate gold watch). The model of hypnosis attributable to Svengali (and the play, Trilby, in which he is a character) is a cod-freudianism even less correct than freudianism; there’s no psychic censor to bypass. So we’ve got a protoscience being appropriated by a pseudoscience, misapplied to a different set of technologies. Every link in that chain is broken; just a river of garbage down the shitpile of history. The third is neurological: we’ve found experimentally that while you can ‘read’ (i.e., half-recognize and prime) individual words, you can’t unconsciously ‘read’ whole sentences in a way that has any interesting effect on behavior. Actually, subliminal messages <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">always</em> have weaker effects than consciously percieved messages.</p><p name="02ed" id="02ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I just said the technical term <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">prime</em>, so let’s break down what that means.</p><p name="63fc" id="63fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nervous systems have a priming effect. When you do a stimulus repeatedly, responses get faster. When you do a related stimulus, responses also get faster, but they accelerate at a slower rate. This rate seems proportional to the distance of the relation and inversely proportional to the complexity of the network. (Behaviorists: sorry if I got everything wrong here. The point is, priming is a nervous system thing, not a ‘consciousness’ thing.)</p><p name="bdac" id="bdac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, when you see a word, before you can consciously perceive it, the process that normally leads to conscious perception starts. Then, in the case of subliminals, it stops. The pattern of neurons that was half-activated sits there, getting blue balls, slowly leaking ions like a spurned lover. It looks for a rebound, and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">boom</em>, we have a synthetic connection. This is where we see the effect in the early priming studies (which have withstood replication): perceiving things in ways that are subtle enough to not enter conscious perception (at least, in memory) can still make you more likely to recognize it or a closely related thing.</p><p name="231f" id="231f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What things are <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">not</em> true about subliminal messages? Well, more or less all the ideas that are unintuitive to somebody who believes in a neural basis for cognition are also the ideas that don’t replicate or are admitted fakes or transparently bad experimental design, or were invented by a novelist, playwright, or screenwriter. Just as the words can’t stay in the memory long enough to give you a command in your head, you’re also not going to magically memorize books like was promised with somnopedia. In fact, the effect is less strong than consciously-percieved things! These primings last for less than half a second after the stimulus is removed, and follow the usual stimulus response curves. What’s more, they decay based on complication, so ‘social priming’ results of the ‘florida knits alone’ type would be expected to be so weak as to be well below the noise floor (and indeed, the replications of this rube goldberg ass experimental design have never succeeded and the author has admitted to fabricating all his data and plaigarism and stuff).</p><p name="8ded" id="8ded" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So what good is it then? You can’t get people to buy Coke that way!</p><p name="81d4" id="81d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, you can combine priming with other things to get some interesting (if not profitable) effects.</p><p name="3991" id="3991" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The heavy hitter here is the mere exposure effect. Mere exposure effect is stimulus-response curve writ large: when something is very novel, reaction to it is tentative; as exposure increases, we like it more, until peak saturation, at which point we find it irritating. If stimulus continues, eventually we hate it. Hold off, later on we get a wave of nostalgia every once in a while, echoing through the waters of time. Mere exposure ties into a bunch of other stuff: faces we’ve seen flashed before our eyes a bunch of times look way hotter ten minutes later in a university psych department’s spare room; unfamiliar vocabulary words become easier to learn the definitions and spellings of if they’ve been flashed before your eyes for a third of a second a couple dozen times. That second one sure looks like an application to me!</p><p name="4982" id="4982" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What’s more: emotionally loaded words prime emotions. This is still subject to response curves, whatever. But as long as you don’t build up a tolerance, flashing nice words when you’re feeling sad (or even looping the same positive affirmations for hours) can be very helpful.</p><p name="162e" id="162e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Primed words affect the interpretation of other, ambiguous words. This one is very versatile. Thing is, often my thinking gets stuck in a rut. I’m not as creative as I would like to be. Throughout history, whenever creativity failed, stochastic technologies have stepped in: sources of randomness such as systematic derangement of the senses through drugs or fasting or lack of sleep or prolonged sexual stimulation or dancing or being beaten or observing fine art, or mechanical technologies such as lull’s paper wheels or tarot cards or oblique strategies or cutups or tape cutups or david bowie’s verbasizer or exquisite corpse or cards against humanity or the entrails of a blessed calf or the fly on the ceiling or the tea and the cheese curd or the omens the portents the lapis lazuli headdress is her dominion and when this happened, the mechanism typically eventually propels the artist out of the creative rut. In machine learning this is called simulated annealing, by analogy from metallurgy. TVTropes used to call it “It works better when I kick it”, I think.</p><p name="6984" id="6984" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How I use subliminal messages most of the time combines priming interpretation as a randomness source for creative ruts with a cascade effect I think might be triggered with enough density. Basically, if primings affect interpretations of ambiguous words, then so long as they are close enough together, primings can affect other primings. This is to say that while you cannot firmly embed the meaning of a sentence into someone’s consciousness through priming without them noticing, you can cause somewhat chaotic semantic pileups: you can raise the noise floor of your brain and do a sort of random seeding of connections that might be useful to make in the future, in a more or less continuous way (so that while collisions are rare, they do appreciably happen — by collision I mean that a useful idea has been clearly facilitated by this process — and they seem to increase with exposure). Basically, if you have enough different, novel streams of subliminal messages appearing at once, for long periods of time, with some elements repeating verbatim many times but other elements changed up constantly to keep up a sense of novelty, you can get these little semantic pileups of vague impressions that coalesce into chaotic, autonomous, phantom-like half-ideas. These half-ideas percolate in the back of my brain. They seem to go into the same place where my dreams are seeded and where story ideas and idle doodles come from. Sometimes they show themselves — when they see themselves reflected in the outside world. Usually they’re in the shadows, at the edge of the woodline, under the bridge, in the attic, in the gas station restroom, behind the denny’s, this denny’s, waiting in the terminal 13 lounge at 3 am gazing at the half-illuminated fridge display of the panera bread that won’t open for another five hours and you’re jet lagged and this hotel room has exactly the same painting as the last hotel room wait is this the same room did i dream the flight oh shit no wait the carpet’s different i guess they must have a central supplier i mean it’s a print right no actually there’s brushstrokes they have a factory in china, at the fridge in the middle of the night, the ice machine rattles and you can’t sleep because it’s so hot. But sometimes they come out to say hi.</p><p name="9886" id="9886" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I’ve been doing this at varying intensities, with various modifications, since 2004 or 2005. I’ve written about it a couple times and I know a couple people who have done it a little bit (and I’ve done it with some of them, which is another interesting effect: similar primed responses gets misinterpreted as mirroring and treated as a signal that you like the other person, so if you spend about 20 minutes watching the same sublims as somebody else you’re best buds for like six hours; I once got laid this way, but in my defense I didn’t know about the effect yet and that experience is what caused me to figure it out, so please don’t use this knowledge for evil). However, I don’t think anybody has done it as much as I have. My brain, weird and semi-functional as it is, is the end result of this mad science experiment. If you like my brain and want to screw yours up in interesting ways too, I have released my subliminal message software and it works ok on ubuntu: <a href="https://github.com/enkiv2/asublim" data-href="https://github.com/enkiv2/asublim" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/enkiv2/asublim</a></p></div></div></section>
