Getting a functional development environment up and running on a Mac is just as hard as getting one up on Linux, so long as you’re OK with typing — the difficulties with homebrew are almost exactly the same because homebrew is basically just a unix-style package system! If you’re trying to get XCode to work properly and you’re used to vim, you’re going to have a lot more trouble with that than you would with installing a full development toolchain (minus IDE, because an IDE isn’t useful or necessary) on another unix.</p><p name="28b0" id="28b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Maybe you have a fat wallet and your idea of marginal value is different from mine, but I’d rather pay a few hundred dollars less and install my own unix on a machine that will continue to work if I drop it.</p></div></div></section>
