The b.bar() in your gist, since it’s at the top level, is essentially an import-time operation.

(Of course, with a large existing codebase, converting all dependency injection to this form is tough — or even all dependency hierarchies beyond some problematic point! One might be motivated to make this change but not have the authority, as well.)</p></div></div></section>
