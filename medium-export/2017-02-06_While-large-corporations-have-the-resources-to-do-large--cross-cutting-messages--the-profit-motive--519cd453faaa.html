<section name="2a7f" class="section section--body section--first section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="1254" id="1254" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">While large corporations have the resources to do large, cross-cutting messages, the profit motive severely limits how effective they can reasonably allow themselves to be. Ultimately, a corporation cannot take a strong stance unless they are confident that most of their customers already agree with that stance — to do otherwise would be suicidal — and so they are obliged to lag behind the rest of society, tending to be more conservative &amp; to accept regressive ideas for longer simply out of fear of lost profits.</p><p name="2451" id="2451" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, they can avoid the risk by micro-targetting advertising &amp; making sure they always preach to the choir — but then, they can never have a positive social impact (and may actually have a net negative social impact).</p><p name="e8f2" id="e8f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In other words, the profit motive inherently conflicts with the arc of history. (Social progress depends upon upsetting the comfortable and comforting the upset — in other words, on sacrificing the favor of the powerful in order to redistribute power more equitably — and this means real negative impact on one’s power and wealth in the short term with no guarantee of greater power in the long term.)</p><p name="91f4" id="91f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Untargeted advertising, for now, does cross boundaries. But, untargeted advertising reaches fewer people than ever. Large events with huge audiences like the superb owl are the exception, not the rule: who even has a TV anymore, or a cable subscription, or purchases paper magazines?</p><p name="6a74" id="6a74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is possible, for someone with plenty of resources and an interest in social justice, to engineer targetted advertising intended to change the opinions of specific audiences — not by having a shared ad experience that poorly targets everyone &amp; tries to make a social statement while also shilling for a product, but by addressing each niche in terms they understand.</p><p name="a6a9" id="a6a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Unfortunately, the only values shared across most of the world now are the ones that all advertising implicitly shares: the idea that money can be traded for happiness, and the idea that there is no alternative to a system based on the sale of labor.</p></div></div></section>
