Just as nomadic precarious contract work became ubiquitous, we’re seeing exactly that sort of work shut down as a medical risk.</blockquote><blockquote name="b717" id="b717" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--pullquote">Because those folks have had their social safety net eroded away, even right-wing politicians have been forced to adopt policies that have been among the most far-fetched dreams of radical leftists for decades — basic income, rent jubilees — just as the popular demand for those policies has reached near-revolutionary levels.

He liked to use not just his wrist, not just his arm, but even his core muscles when drawing, and when he did speed-sketching, it became an aerobic affair. Electrolytes are important for health, and must be replenished: despite all the precautions, people still got the corona (or something milder).

The slightly higher risk from tele-operated vehicles (due to lag &amp; the threat of actual disconnection) will be compensated for by the substantially lower traffic, and even without taking that into account, folks will probably consider it safer than riding in a car with another human being.</blockquote><figure name="81de" id="81de" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--pullquote"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 788px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 150%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*Ml6_FPboWF3UN8cs" data-width="3200" data-height="4800" data-unsplash-photo-id="5Rr9AwgAFAk" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*Ml6_FPboWF3UN8cs"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@maxwbender?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@maxwbender?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Max Bender</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p name="b2ce" id="b2ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The asphalt on the street was already beginning to revert into gravel, and his steps crunched loudly despite the soft drizzle. The fog made opalescent halos around the streetlights, except those whose solar panels had become obscured by bird’s nests or creeping vines. In the distance, coyotes and foxes howled duets to the autumn moon. He had heard rumors that mountain lions had been sighted again — mostly by home security cameras, but a few by delivery drone or telecab. They didn’t know to be afraid of the street lights or the glowing windows of houses anymore, though he doubted that he would meet any wildlife in his current neon-alien-predator getup.</em></p><p name="26f2" id="26f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">He liked nights like this. The two block span from his home to the convenience store had become the site of a weekly meditation. In the summer only night-walks were tolerable, but in the winter the nearly constant gentle rains changed their meaning for him and became an excitingly crisp counterpoint to the homeyness of the glow from the windows along the street.</em></p><p name="314c" id="314c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">He occasionally saw a stranger or two in the distance, and this too became part of his meditation: featureless silhouettes taking on the feel of mysterious icons in a dream-cathedral. These nameless figures felt as unreal to him as the rest of the outside, and sometimes he almost expected them to teleport, disappear, shapeshift, or take on sudden ominous significance the way dream-figures often do.</em></p><p name="3c35" id="3c35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">When he was a child he had a recurring dream that his grandmother would arrive unexpectedly at his door but when she opened her mouth, waves of static would pour out. In recent years, that dream has transformed: the shadow people in the distance in the perpetual backlit fog of the dim outside sprout mouths like shimmering Os of television static, widening to consume their whole head, letting out smoke that chases him.</em></p><p name="3f83" id="3f83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">None of the silhouettes have ever done this in reality — as far as he can tell — but Tim cannot reliably distinguish the dream-street from the real street, or the dream-fog from the real fog, especially when his sleep has gone accidentally polyphasic again, so he remains vigilant. This, too, is part of his meditation.</em></p><figure name="00d1" id="00d1" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*mPEZsoepalvEaL2s.jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1333" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*mPEZsoepalvEaL2s.jpg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/proof/2018/february/japan-hikikomori-isolation-society/" data-href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/proof/2018/february/japan-hikikomori-isolation-society/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Image from National Geographic</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote name="65dd" id="65dd" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--figure">We can learn a lot about how people would act in a world where going out is discouraged by looking at the behaviors of hikkikomori and the technologies that enable them. Vending machines and 24-hour convenience stores are a godsend for the pathologically socially anxious, and a lifesaver in a prolonged pandemic.</blockquote><blockquote name="ad28" id="ad28" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--pullquote">Contact with human clerks can be avoided altogether using automation, but many of the tasks that must be performed by convenience store clerks, while they can be performed by robotic arms paired with a skilled operator, cannot be performed by current AI today. We should expect telepresence to bridge this gap, with clerks working from home along the call-center model.</blockquote><blockquote name="9d9e" id="9d9e" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--pullquote">Since a prolonged pandemic gets rid of whole classes of service jobs (waitstaff, much of restaurant kitchen staff, taxi and rideshare drivers), we should expect UBI or something similar to be instated. This will probably lower the number of people willing to work as clerks in convenience stores. However, since those stores will get less frequent traffic, telepresence multiplexing makes sense: have one person administer many stores.</blockquote><figure name="788c" id="788c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--pullquote"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 466px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66.5%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*O1SImkwDcF8foury" data-width="4076" data-height="2712" data-unsplash-photo-id="npxXWgQ33ZQ" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*O1SImkwDcF8foury"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@glenncarstenspeters?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@glenncarstenspeters?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Glenn Carstens-Peters</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote name="757c" id="757c" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--figure">On the other hand, we should expect performance-oriented jobs like video game streaming, vlogging, and streaming-video sex work to become much more common, as the difference between doing it as a hobby &amp; doing it as a real job blurs.</blockquote><blockquote name="3738" id="3738" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--pullquote">Some previously-unnecessary tasks can also be fully automated.

By the time the blender had squirted its clotted stream of mayonnaise, the boy was already back at his book.

Anyhow, polyamory is so much easier when you can ghost your way out of problems, and Tim owed his current romantic success largely, he thought, to the fact that none of his partners ever had to be in the same room as him. Once, he went to concerts, danced in mosh pits. He used to spit on the street sometimes, just to punctuate a point. He couldn’t imagine himself doing those things. He couldn’t put himself in the shoes of his younger self.
