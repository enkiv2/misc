Where once we merely had pinkwashing, greenwashing, tokenism, and queerbaiting, now we have the removal of Elmer Fudd’s gun, the removal of episodes of sitcoms explicitly criticizing blackface, and flooding useful tags with black squares.</p><p name="41a2" id="41a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s almost universally counterproductive:</p><figure name="809d" id="809d" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/GangofH/status/1277309755476803586"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></figure><figure name="1445" id="1445" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--figure"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/jsisincendium/status/1277307038092189702"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></figure><figure name="067a" id="067a" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--figure"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/priyavprabhakar/status/1277335668956360705"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></figure><p name="71bf" id="71bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Hanlon’s Razor suggests that it isn’t some conspiracy to discredit SJ (although it does so by accident) but that most of the media infrastructure actually has exactly as shallow an idea of social justice as the right.</p><p name="6ad7" id="6ad7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This shouldn’t be surprising. Social justice work, properly implemented, requires thought and flexibility. It doesn’t scale. It’s complicated. Everybody I know who isn’t actually invested on a personal level with social justice circles has a shallow, warped, and universalizing idea of it, because if you don’t have a particular interest, then your idea of it will come from media, and the less interest you have, the shallower the media. What the media will cover is the performative bullshit that can be codified by media-industry legal departments.</p><p name="a8de" id="a8de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Elmer Fudd’s gun isn’t going away because of real outcry, but because one guy in corporate has a vague idea that loud nuts might do a twitter campaign &amp; the only guy in the legal dept who has heard of social justice thinks Jordan Peterson “has some solid points but maybe goes too far”. A lot of these folks are the kind of “good liberal” who think that liberal is as far left as one can go and that communism means state control of the distribution of goods. The type who thinks racism ended in 1968 and is glad.</p><p name="c745" id="c745" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe eventually the basic thought processes behind SJ will become accessible to most people, in the same way that once-radical philosophical and political ideas like pragmatism &amp; representative democracy did. American adults can generally understand how voting is supposed to work, because they took a civics class in school. They understand balance of powers, in theory. They can quote you a little bit of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Thoreau but cannot tell you who said what. The language that tea partiers and other American right-libertarian-adjacent groups use (full of invocations of “tyranny”) does not come out of serious autodidacticism, but instead out of half-remembered ideas from seventh grade.</p><p name="050b" id="050b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The basic idea behind SJ &amp; its mechanics is not all that much more complicated or controversial than “innocent until proven guilty” or any number of similar complex philosophical ideas that schoolchildren are required to show proficiency in as part of their duty as citizens. At the same time, if you don’t have an interest in something &amp; you’re not particularly intellectually curious, it’s very easy to stop learning about it entirely as soon as mandatory schooling is over. Even if you <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">do</em> have interest and motivation, contentious issues tend to have a lot of disinformation around them that makes it easy to get strange misunderstandings.</p><p name="4474" id="4474" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Robert Anton Wilson was brilliant but he never quite ‘got’ feminism, because there were currents that didn’t want him to recognize that it was basically the same as other emancipatory movements he supported &amp; that his own wife was more representative of feminism than the SCUM manifesto was. He bought the idea that there were a small number of “good”, “reasonable” feminists and a larger movement of “radical man-haters” instead of the other way around because a media complex existed to promote the idea that sex equality was a trojan horse for authoritarian matriarchy — and this media complex still exists (although it is far less powerful than it was thirty years ago).</p><p name="23d3" id="23d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Scott Alexander is also clearly brilliant but he seems to have had very little direct and in-depth interaction with leftists, which in combination with strange second-hand information, seems to have left him thinking that leftist movements weren’t really worth understanding. (Not even to the level of effort he put into understanding neoreaction, or gematria, or fad diets.)</p><p name="9046" id="9046" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve still got very intelligent, intellectually curious friends (including online — not naming names, you know who you are) who don’t remotely “get” SJ, despite attempts to explain it. Initial framing is strong, so they have a hard time letting go of the idea that social justice is some blunt and legalistic top-down mechanism (a demand to remove complicated representation) instead of a set of tools for improving interpersonal interactions (ideas about how to better avoid being an asshole). I know they are working in good faith so I keep trying to clarify.</p><p name="3bb6" id="3bb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When somebody I know has their heart in the right place comes to me with a misunderstanding of SJ, I try to correct it. That’s hard enough for me to do, &amp; probably much worse for most people.</p><p name="e94d" id="e94d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We don’t really have a great way to communicate this stuff to people outside of our circles. They are getting a mix of intentional and unintentional disinformation through media organs, &amp; real social justice has little to no mainstream media support.</p><p name="e43b" id="e43b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Making it part of school curricula would help, though as an anarchist I’m not terribly comfortable with making decisions about what strangers should be forced to learn. Obviously, talk to your kids, but you’re already doing that right?</p><p name="00e7" id="00e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What do we do?</p><p name="22cd" id="22cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One thing is to try to keep the core message really clear: that society is full of power relations that are complex and largely invisible to the people they benefit, &amp; that we’re looking to make things more equitable by understanding and addressing them. Even a small child can understand that kind of statement.</p><p name="73d5" id="73d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another thing is to try to separate the tools from the core message: the point of SJ isn’t to make the world into a safe space (since that’d be stupid), but a safe space is sometimes the appropriate band-aid.</p><p name="e509" id="e509" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another thing is to use the tools responsibly and talk publicly and clearly about whether or not they are appropriate, in ways that are accessible to outsiders. For instance, no-platforming should be distinguished from “cancelling”, vs boycotting, vs critique.</p><p name="fb6e" id="fb6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Something I’ve been trying to do (with <a href="https://medium.com/the-weird-politics-review/a-libertarian-case-for-social-justice-23ee2237b6f5?source=friends_link&amp;sk=11db912d7205c9635aaf146534741203" data-href="https://medium.com/the-weird-politics-review/a-libertarian-case-for-social-justice-23ee2237b6f5?source=friends_link&amp;sk=11db912d7205c9635aaf146534741203" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">A Libertarian Case for Social Justice</a> and other works) is to aim explainers at audiences who aren’t usually part of social-justice-friendly circles, trying to appeal to their own values.
