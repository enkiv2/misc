If you have, you know what I mean. This article is not that article. I’m going to tell you all of the interesting things about generative text that those articles didn’t cover.</p><p name="e114" id="e114" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You should care about generative text if you care about:</p><h4 name="9054" id="9054" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Video games</h4><p name="7ebe" id="7ebe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Video games have been trying to expand their clout as a narrative medium. While there are a lot of ways to do narrative in an interactive medium, one of the most obvious is to have interactive dialogue. After all, dialogue usually drives narrative in films, books, comics, and TV.</p><p name="6795" id="6795" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unfortunately, dialogue trees don’t scale well: after all, they grow exponentially, and inconsistent or inadequately varied dialogue is extremely obvious. As a result, dialogue-driven interactive narrative is typically limited to big game studios, and truly complex dialogue trees are rare even in game genres that have that as their primary technical focus (such as VNs and adventure games).</p><p name="1c7d" id="1c7d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The same way that, five years ago, indie game developers started looking toward procedural world generation as a way of creating large maps that allowed them to compete with large development houses’ sandbox games in terms of scale, <a href="http://forum.makega.me/t/procedural-narrative-dialogue/91" data-href="http://forum.makega.me/t/procedural-narrative-dialogue/91" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">indie game developers now are beginning to look at the various ideas in the field of text generation</a> for ideas about automatically generating varied dialogue and dialogue trees from models of character and narrative. <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/07/01/chris-crawford/" data-href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/07/01/chris-crawford/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The next Minecraft might derive its scale from procedural expansion of NPC dialogue instead of procedural expansion of the map</a>.</p><h4 name="0595" id="0595" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Journalism</h4><p name="00f6" id="00f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Right now, because of the use of advertising for monetization of content, a lot of internet ‘journalism’ is clickbait — in other words, content optimized for page view counts rather than for sustained attention. Clickbait is generated at low cost by content farms; it’s poor-quality because being high-quality is a net loss, and it’s short because that’s cheaper than being long. Clickbait optimizes for two things: number of ads on a page and number of people who will click a link. However, generative text is extremely promising for content farm owners: after all, even if you’re paying content farmers pennies an hour, you’re still paying more for these humans than you would for machines, who can generate far more content far more quickly with only slightly lower average quality. The kind of A/B testing that content farms use for optimizing their headlines is, furthermore, a perfect match for existing methods by which relatively simple AIs can use feedback to improve their headline generation — and AIs are already pretty good at generating clickbait headlines. In other words, machines might well easily replace the lowest end of internet journalism.</p><p name="336a" id="336a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the same time, text generation is already beginning to supplant the lowest end of traditional paper journalism, with various organizations automatically generating minor financial and sports stories. This frees up human writers to be put on more interesting stories, or to alternately be fired, depending upon the skill of the writer and the financial situation of the news agency.</p><p name="98b7" id="98b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Both of these effects are truly huge potential economic shifts in these industries. And, they have the potential to be truly positive, as well. Consider Buzzfeed, which makes its money off inane clickbait content and then turns around and funds wonderfully deep serious journalism by serious journalists about interesting subjects with all that shit-click money: if they automated their low-quality high-lucre content, they could shift more of their workforce toward high-quality journalism. Alternately, the slightly lower quality of machine-written articles versus content-farmed articles might accelerate the devaluation of clickbait and cause <a href="https://medium.com/@enkiv2/alternatives-to-advertising-7af0e32b8a8e#.r7943d2xy" data-href="https://medium.com/@enkiv2/alternatives-to-advertising-7af0e32b8a8e#.r7943d2xy" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">alternatives to ad-based monetization</a> to become more popular more quickly.</p><h4 name="f1af" id="f1af" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Psychology</h4><p name="32ca" id="32ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The effectiveness of generative text is the result of an interplay between the design of the generator and the human audience. The best generators lean heavily on the human element, using rich associations and loaded structures to convince the reader to project meaning onto the text, which itself is very often structurally simple. All of this is to say that a large part of the design of text generators is psychology. Invert this, and it’s not at all surprising that text generators are being used by experimental psychologists to probe the human mind.</p><p name="eb09" id="eb09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just recently, there’s been press coverage of <a href="http://journal.sjdm.org/15/15923a/jdm15923a.pdf" data-href="http://journal.sjdm.org/15/15923a/jdm15923a.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a study using a new-age BS generator to study personality traits associated with the projection of meaning</a>, as well as of <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/04/underwire_0401_funnycomputer/" data-href="http://www.wired.com/2014/04/underwire_0401_funnycomputer/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/opinion/sunday/can-computers-be-funny.html" data-href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/opinion/sunday/can-computers-be-funny.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">group </a><a href="https://www.abdn.ac.uk/ncs/departments/computing-science/standup-315.php" data-href="https://www.abdn.ac.uk/ncs/departments/computing-science/standup-315.php" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">of</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5276366.stm" data-href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5276366.stm" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">older</a> <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P11/P11-2016.pdf" data-href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P11/P11-2016.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">studies</a> using joke generators to study the mechanics of humor. Text generation allows psychology experiments to scale up and to have extremely fine control over the material they use; when text generators used in psychology experiments have their source made available, later experimenters can tweak the generator in various ways in order to easily test variations on the original experiments, and text generators can be hooked up directly to systems like Mechanical Turk that allow experimenters to expand their studies outside the college campus.</p><h4 name="b397" id="b397" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Spam</h4><p name="ab4c" id="ab4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The spam industry is the only segment of the tech world to really take text generation seriously. Spammers have been using techniques like<a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2013/12/22/spam-comment-generator-script" data-href="http://alexking.org/blog/2013/12/22/spam-comment-generator-script" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> text spinning</a> to trick both humans and AI filters for more than a decade. As technology improves, spam will get better. Any advances in text generation will probably be employed by spammers first.</p><h4 name="36e5" id="36e5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Ebooks</h4><p name="8bf0" id="8bf0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/23/ebook-spam-problem-growing" data-href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/23/ebook-spam-problem-growing" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A few years ago, Amazon had a problem with machine-generated reference books of poor quality</a>. These reference books would be produced based on search queries, which were fed into Wikipedia and the resulting pages combined, initially into a print-on-demand book but later into ebooks. It’s a little unclear to me how Amazon fixed this problem, but it doesn’t seem to be such a big deal anymore.</p><p name="6dec" id="6dec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, this is not the only con in Amazon’s ebook ecosystem. Today, the big money is in creating hyper-targeted erotica[<a href="http://thehustle.co/underground-world-of-kindle-ebooks" data-href="http://thehustle.co/underground-world-of-kindle-ebooks" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="http://thehustle.co/part-2-confessions-from-the-scammy-underground-world-of-kindle-ebooks" data-href="http://thehustle.co/part-2-confessions-from-the-scammy-underground-world-of-kindle-ebooks" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="http://thehustle.co/part-3-confessions-from-the-scammy-underground-world-of-kindle-ebooks" data-href="http://thehustle.co/part-3-confessions-from-the-scammy-underground-world-of-kindle-ebooks" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">3</a>]. Consumers of erotic fiction often don’t care very much about prose quality, or are prevented by fear of social stigma from being vocal in their criticism of poor-quality prose in erotica. Erotic fiction is extremely popular, and hyper-specific subgenres have their own categories on Amazon, which means that it’s fairly easy to get to bestseller status in a single category (and thus have a boost in sales resulting from a listing on bestseller pages).</p><p name="02ac" id="02ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Again, text generation is a very good fit for erotica. <a href="https://github.com/enkiv2/NaNoGenMo-2015/blob/master/orgasmotron.gg" data-href="https://github.com/enkiv2/NaNoGenMo-2015/blob/master/orgasmotron.gg" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">It is easy to generate </a><a href="https://github.com/enkiv2/NaNoGenMo-2015/blob/master/orgasmotron.md" data-href="https://github.com/enkiv2/NaNoGenMo-2015/blob/master/orgasmotron.md" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">arbitrary amounts of poor-quality erotica</a>. Erotica is either effective or comical: even bad erotica is good. While existing cons for Amazon erotica ebooks often involve taking public domain erotica and publishing it with a few easily automated changes, there’s no reason that brand new erotic fiction couldn’t be generated in various categories at the kind of rate that only machines can keep up with.</p><h4 name="0df2" id="0df2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">UI design</h4><p name="880e" id="880e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Partly because of the hype behind Slack and Siri, conversational UIs have become <a href="https://medium.com/@enkiv2/this-is-not-no-ui-it-s-text-based-ui-c4e5991b7edb#.cn9qgdc8u" data-href="https://medium.com/@enkiv2/this-is-not-no-ui-it-s-text-based-ui-c4e5991b7edb#.cn9qgdc8u" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">trendy recently</a>. Those of us of my generation will recall the failure modes of conversational UIs. (Remember SmarterChild?)
