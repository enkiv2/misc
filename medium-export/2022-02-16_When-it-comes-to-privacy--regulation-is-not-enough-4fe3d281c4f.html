<section name="7a65" class="section section--body section--first section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="e031" id="e031" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title">When it comes to privacy, regulation is not enough</h3><p name="2d99" id="2d99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Opsec is hard. When making opsec decisions, you must decide whether it is safe for you to let some second party know something about you — a decision that depends on who you are, who the second party is, and the resources, incentives, and material circumstances of both.</p><p name="4a1f" id="4a1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This calculation changes dramatically over time: at age 16, photographs of you getting drunk at a party are highly sensitive and can really only be shared with people you trust not to narc on you, but those same photographs are just fine at age 21, however, if you decide at 33 to run for political office then they once again become dangerous. It changes with circumstances: if you live in LA then it’s probably safe to be openly gay, but if you are forced to move to rural North Carolina you may want to go back into the closet for your own safety. It changes with technology: if some new technique for decoding distorted text comes out, then the street signs in the background of a low-resolution picture of you near your house are suddenly available to your stalker or abusive ex. It changes with incentives and access to resources: if the government decides you might be a terrorist or KiwiFarms decides you might be cringey, everything you ever said or did will be scoured for potential evidence by people who are already against you and are willing to spend hundreds of man-hours on speculation.</p><p name="8911" id="8911" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These changes suck, because once someone has a piece of information, they potentially have it forever.</p><p name="8805" id="8805" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most social networks are mostly public by default — which is to say, once you post something, it is effectively potentially-permanent, because even if you delete it, someone might have taken a screenshot while it was visible. Public posts also make that second party in the opsec arithmetic, potentially, everyone living on the planet now or in the future.</p><p name="8e2f" id="8e2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Privacy advocates tend to focus on campaigning large corporations and lobbying for regulations (which is to say, campaigning the large corporation that is the state). This makes sense on one level: it is possible to do a lot of good with regard to the kind of data people don’t know they are leaking with a minimum of effort (as with the GDPR, which is a pretty good start — it theoretically keeps small corporations from storing and re-selling data to third parties, though large corporations can eat the fines because they are making more money from the sales than they are losing and small corporations can simply hope they won’t be caught).</p><p name="b94c" id="b94c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, lobbying is necessarily a matter of letting the fox watch the henhouse: governments and large corporations are most capable of large-scale surveillance, benefit the most from doing it, and risk the least from large-scale internal illegal behavior. It is also a matter of looking under the lamp post for your keys because that’s where the light is: as a lobbyist, neither you nor the people you interact with on the other side of the table are required (or even expected) to grapple with the complexity of actual opsec, because you are at best creating a single policy for a “normal” person (probably without really interrogating that model — consider that most women have experienced stalking, and that the majority of people in the united states belong to at least one ‘minority’ ethnic group targeted for systematic eradication by known domestic terrorist groups, and you will see that the model implicitly guiding most privacy legislation is woefully inadequate), and at worst you are writing common-sense platitudes on powerpoint slides and expecting fawning adoration for it.</p><p name="1d06" id="1d06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ultimately, a reasonable default privacy policy is not really possible. Furthermore, I cannot trust a government or corporation to create a customized default privacy policy for me, because I cannot trust a government or corporation with the data necessary to make even basic privacy decisions.</p><p name="35af" id="35af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So what is the alternative?</p><p name="b306" id="b306" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Since we cannot trust corporations, we cannot trust centralized platforms (which require corporations for upkeep costs). The alternative is a large variety of small, independent implementations of open protocols for distributed peer to peer communication, with only local records only stored by the parties engaged in any specific communication. Open protocols have their own network effect, not tied to choice of client. For a variety of small independent implementations to exist, the protocol must be easy to implement and hard to screw up. Since even then we can’t necessarily trust our peers with everything, we need to teach our friends about opsec and risk analysis.</p></div></div></section>
