In particular, he praises leaflets aimed at enemies that encourage desertion by widening already-existing ethnic and class divisions, sparking and amplifying justified fears (that command considers infantry disposable, or that military personnel from a not-yet-fully-trusted ally are engaged in affairs with soldiers’ families back home), and creating and delivering on incentives (such as claiming that POWs are treated well and then actually treating them well).</p><p name="5735" id="5735" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Information on the behavior of espionage outfits is thinner on the ground, but moles have been known to identify and amplify the fixations of the intelligence outfits they are infiltrating (as with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Jesus_Angleton" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Jesus_Angleton" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Angleton</a>’s obsession with finding moles — an obsession that hampered his agency’s effectiveness), agent-provocateurs try to push existing tendencies in the direction of violence and disorder (as with the COINTELPRO infiltration of the Black Panther Party, which aimed to create greater friction with both the police and various organizations that the Panthers might otherwise have aligned with), and military intelligence is sometimes involved in operations that rely upon local myth (such as the use of loudspeakers broadcasting mocked-up voices of dead soldiers in the style of Southeast Asian ideas of the afterlife, assassinations of enemy soldiers that mimic the supposed MO of a particular deadly supernatural beast from their tradition, and the projection of an image of the Virgin Mary onto the bottom of bomber planes flying at night over majority-Catholic countries).</p><figure name="aa46" id="aa46" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 428px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 81.6%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*sp2IGhL-V87AvyHl.jpg" data-width="734" data-height="599" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*sp2IGhL-V87AvyHl.jpg"></div></figure><p name="b3df" id="b3df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Colonial rulers have repeatedly seen the fallout of not understanding the mechanics of the beliefs of their colonized subjects (as with the use of pig-based lard in ammunition given to Muslim British subjects).
