But you can also practice magick without acknowledging any forces not accepted in scientific consensus or proposing any mechanisms that would be a tough sell to a scientist.</p><p name="8c97" id="8c97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This often makes talking to “skeptics” hard! Some magick practitioners are really attached to dubious models (many of them scientistic though not scientific — ex., quantum anything), but a lot of the time a skeptic will say “that’s not magic, that’s just availability bias” and the Magus will try to explain “no, you’re missing the point — it’s availability bias, but when you *use* availability bias, that’s magick”.</p><p name="d3ea" id="d3ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So on the one hand, you can have magick that completely overlaps with science in its content, but differs in form &amp; intent. Magick is like engineering, in that it applies science toward a goal, but it also does things that are anathema to science &amp; engineering because it specifically involves fucking with your experimental apparatus (the practitioner engaging in temporary tactical self-deception), which is sort of like self-modifying code in that it can be super useful but is also dangerous in its unpredictability.</p><p name="3d80" id="3d80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">But at the same time, magick deals specifically with fractalline paradoxes a lot (what GEB calls strange loops). Really, self-deception falls into this category. These structures can’t be flattened into a non-paradoxical form so they lie outside the frameworks that would render then internally inconsistent. “Nonsense is nonsense but the history of nonsense is a science” was the justification used to study kabbalah in an anthropolical and sociological context and this is typical of how science tries to integrate the parts of magick that aren’t protoscience: go to a meta level and don’t actually engage with the paradox at all, just describe it as though it was somebody else’s problem. But these paradoxes are important: they are the engine of magick, and they’re sort of infectious. Magick contains little pockets of irresolvable chaos that make everything they touch more tangled and hazy</p></div></div></section>
