Small computing products are quirky because they are created by a single person or a handful of people to solve their own problems in a way that corresponds to their own workflow; as they grow, they tend to become highly customizable application platforms with reasonable defaults because expansion occurs through supporting new users with new workflows.</p><p name="f433" id="f433" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The browser text field, like most webtech, comes out of someone saying “this theoretical feature is something we ought to have in order to compete; let us consider abstractly what we, as developers who touch only a tiny minority of use cases, would expect the minimal feature set could be in order to satisfy all users”. In other words, a big tech mentality from the start. You get a committee together to imagine what a very distinct set of unrepresented users might want, and then the developers get a checklist of intended behaviors, some of which contradict each other. Then it gets standardized or de-facto standardized, and you get almost identically-behaving implementations in all the major browsers.</p><p name="e07e" id="e07e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tiny and quirky writing tools still exist, still are in use, and still are created. Vi and emacs are arguably quirky writing tools, and are widely used. I wrote a specialized text editor that had support for color coding word black/whitelists, recommending the next word via markov models that could be easily swapped out (or have their probabilities reversed), rhyming dictionary and thesaurus lookup, and S+7 replacement. Robin Sloane wrote a plugin for Atom that tried to complete his sentences with char-RNN. Botnik Studios uses a specialized “keyboard” that’s really a markov-based autocomplete oriented text editor. And, of course, we have a wide variety of proprietary ‘boutique’ editors like Scrivener and Hemingway. On top of that, there remain specialized editors for proper hypertext (like Twine, which though it produces web-compatible output, really has a lot more in common with 80s hypertext-fiction editing systems like Hypercard and StorySpace).</p><p name="9c05" id="9c05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These systems don’t get a lot of exposure because there are lowest-common-denominator systems that eat up most of the bandwidth for familiarity for most users. Word is an ascended-quirky-writing-tool that, because it became institutionally mandated, had its quirks sclerotized into standardization; it and its bug-compatible clones (Google Docs, libreoffice) are used by everyone. Completely minimal editors like notepad are everywhere too. It’s been a long time since anybody thought it was a good idea to ship a computer with a program as quirky as LotusNotes by default.</p><p name="bda2" id="bda2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Basically, if a field has incumbents, then so long as you are deciding what to look at based on popularity, you will not see quirky fringe experiments and specialized tools. When a field is young, quirky fringe experiments and specialized tools are all that exists, but they can never grow to dominate without losing their quirk and specialization.</p></div></div></section>
