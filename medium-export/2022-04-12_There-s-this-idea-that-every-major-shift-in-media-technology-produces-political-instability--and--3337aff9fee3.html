<section name="5d78" class="section section--body section--first section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="7d57" id="7d57" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">There’s this idea that every major shift in media technology produces political instability, and that’s absolutely true. But the people who say this (ex., KK) don’t talk about <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">why</em> and how the form of the medium influences the nature of the political formations.</p><p name="ca27" id="ca27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The most obvious ramification is actually related to how centralized meaning-making ends up being — something that has to do deeply with exactly how much support you need to speak, and how far your voice goes as a result.</p><p name="b557" id="b557" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Prior to widespread literacy, you basically couldn’t reliably spread ideas beyond a small geographical area. Reality was <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">extremely</em> fragmented. A big factor in empire-building was sending people who could read to far-flung places to read out the decisions of rulers.</p><p name="51a7" id="51a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Religious centralization by the catholic church was basically an expanded form of this: a whole hierarchy of literate people, distributed to various mostly-illiterate places after heavy training in a particular set of dogmas.</p><p name="9dd1" id="9dd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before printing, this structure was also how books got reproduced: scribes would copy existing books as part of their training, either by consulting an existing copy (for the fancy expensive ones) or by transcribing the words of someone who was reading aloud. In other words, most codices from before the fifteenth century come from the same institutional social form as most cuneiform tablets: they are accidental biproducts of teaching reading and writing to a specialized scholarly class.</p><p name="eac6" id="eac6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Moveable type changes access dramatically. If you want your ideas to go into a book, you don’t need to be put in a position of power by the catholic church; it’s sufficient to merely be rich enough to afford the paper and the plates. But your readers still need to be literate. You get a new class of merchants (booksellers and publishers) who are coevolving with a new class of literate consumers, and each promotes the other. You also get an information infrastructure that privileges the merely rich over church hierarchy (which is also the state).</p><p name="9ec6" id="9ec6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When paper becomes dramatically cheaper, it starts to make sense to broaden literacy even further, and you get: chapbooks, broadsheets, encyclopedias. Also, more people are able to afford to print (because the press is cheap compared to the paper). Even at this stage, most people are not literate, &amp; so the information landscape is still super fragmented. This is all a rich man’s game still. That starts to change when political projects built by the printing class incorporate standardized education into their ideas. (In other words, the french and american revolutions mostly.)</p><p name="18db" id="18db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even so, having independent organizations writing and reading books — having dramatically different viewpoints — ends up supporting democratic &amp; sometimes proto-anarchist movements. ut really widespread literacy doesn’t happen until the 20th century, as a result of the standardized schooling model pioneered in france being implemented all over the place (mostly as part of colonial projects’ PR wings). It coincides with a recentralization in the 20th c.</p><p name="cf25" id="cf25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the late 19th century, new technologies for expanding the range of private bidirectional communication (telegraph, telephone, radio) appear. In the early 20th century, radio becomes a regulated broadcast medium and gets combined with other broadcast media like loudspeakers. Around this time, some technologies show up to compete with moveable type, and some of them are accessible to regular people. Mimeography and xerography make reproduction cheap, though the geographical impact is limited by the price of mail. Postcards are private but cheaper mail.</p><p name="90a3" id="90a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the middle of the 20th century, the beats &amp; hippies were fed revolutionary new ideas by the same technology that fed the GI Bill and upwardly-mobile fashionably-intellectual set: cheap and portable paperback books, many of them by public intellectuals. To get a paperback published in the 50s you still need permission from a publisher, but running a small press becomes doable for the only moderately filthy-rich. And regular people can afford to buy books on a whim, when they’re twenty five cents.</p><p name="86d5" id="86d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the 60s you see the very first examples of what we might call “zines” — the intersection of xerography and publishing — and by the 70s zines become very important across cultural domains. At the same time, the internet is created (though locked up in big institutions).</p><p name="4af8" id="4af8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The internet combines two things that haven’t been really combined before in the history of media: people without already-existing political, commercial, or institutional power can say things that get distributed across geographic and cultural boundaries. (Arguably BBSes did this first simply because the internet wasn’t available to “regular people” until long after BBSes were. But I think the political tendencies that BBSes encourage are almost exactly the same as the ones the internet encourage.)</p><p name="bdab" id="bdab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Almost immediately, folks with a lot of money and institutional power start trying to use the internet as a broadcast medium to expand their own influence or try to limit, filter, or reprioritize existing communication by owning shared spaces. Nevertheless, for the first time, the highly-fragmented nature of the information landscape is highly visible for the first time due to the internet. Because we’re living at the tail end of the golden era of broadcast media, it’s a lot less fragmented than it once was.</p><p name="c0a7" id="c0a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s be clear: the wide distribution of centralized and hegemonic memeplexes through broadcast media was never a function of being “true”; it was always a function of money and other forms of power.</p><p name="6a8b" id="6a8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We have a greater ability to discover real truth in our fragmented landscape. At the same time, the artificial flatness of the online landscape produced by most large social networks is terrible for truth-seeking. It’s great to be able to discover people with different beliefs and life-experiences; it terrible to be at the mercy of a barrage of notifications from complete strangers who take the fact you don’t agree with their unconsidered beliefs as license to harass you. It’s taboo to scream in a library, but with a big enough library, there’s bound to be somebody who doesn’t know or doesn’t care. So we need the social equivalent of headphones.</p><p name="5c4b" id="5c4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Important political factors today can be classified into:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="1197" id="1197" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">people who want to go back to a broadcast model with a single hegemonic idea of truth (but disagree about what that truth is)</li><li name="8cb5" id="8cb5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">people who know they can’t convince everybody but want to murder their opponents</li><li name="c0b8" id="c0b8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">people who are happy to navigate a handful of ideological intentional-communities and don’t care much about the ‘mainstream’</li><li name="a44d" id="a44d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">people who really love being cosmopolitan and understanding as many of these social epistemes as possible</li></ol><p name="3723" id="3723" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Groups 2, 3, and 4 all favor fragmentation. There are a lot of us!</p><p name="a692" id="a692" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Group 1 has all the money and all the institutional power. But institutional power is largely executed through people who belong to groups 3 and 4. Group 2 is where all the neo-nazis are, and this kind of screws up the math. Intellectually curious people (including most academics and researchers) are in groups 3 and 4.</p><p name="bd96" id="bd96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">(<a href="https://viewer.scuttlebot.io/%25RDemZbWM4qMtR2qmZc%2Bh%2FBWyYPd9wu%2FiPxlGZPFfrKg%3D.sha256" data-href="https://viewer.scuttlebot.io/%25RDemZbWM4qMtR2qmZc%2Bh%2FBWyYPd9wu%2FiPxlGZPFfrKg%3D.sha256" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Original post</a>)</p></div></div></section>
