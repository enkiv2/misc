This is true to some degree, and was probably more true in the 60s and 70s when these arguments were first being put forth — media having reacted to this by dramatically changing the way violence was depicted and how women were depicted in relation to it. However, growing up in the 90s, my own media indoctrination had a much less violent but much more objectifying flavor.</p><p name="cf24" id="cf24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I watched a lot of sitcoms, romantic comedies, and teen comedies — in other words, I watched a lot of media where awful people (mostly men) tried to get laid, and where character growth (or even just successful scheming) was rewarded with romantic success. Being autistic, I didn’t catch onto some indicators of characters’ internal states, but I would venture that these characters were often very flat and in many cases were having ‘arcs’ only because of the demands of the genre (rather than having their changes in behavior reflect actual underlying changes in belief or character). Ultimately, this media diet promoted the idea that being seen as attractive was a sign from the writers (in other words, God, or the universe) that you were doing the “right thing” (and, in rom coms and teen sex comedies, that you were a “good person”) — in other words, that women’s preferences were an augur for general success.</p><p name="3b20" id="3b20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Violence presumes a subject: cutting up a piece of paper is not violent, because a piece of paper has no interiority, and when one violently rips up a piece of paper, that violence comes from a kind of anthropomorphism or displacement of emotion — the paper is a substitute for the subject of anger. Violent misogyny is therefore not exactly fully objectifying: the violent misogynist does not imagine individual women as separate subjects, but sees individual variation in women as a frustrating inconsistency and/or deception in a single universal female mind; he irrationally expects his violence toward one woman to ripple out to all women, even if his rational mind recognizes the impossibility of this, because he does not care about any individual women enough to imagine their inner experience richly. His violence is against what he is only willing to experience as a single unified subject — the “eternal woman”. But the rom-com model does not suggest a female subjectivity at all: instead, womankind is treated as a passive medium by which God speaks to men, in the language of meet-cutes, hookups, and rejections.</p><p name="6916" id="6916" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The rise of incel-community-associated violence (and the connection between incel groups and racist groups — especially those which focus on notions of traditionalism) appears to draw on a hybrid of these two models. One’s inability to get laid is treated both as a pervasive cruel shallowness in the single universal female subject and as the wrath of a god punishing humanity for deviation from traditional practices, as though these two things were interchangeable. If we only address one of these ideas, then the other continues to fester — and while plenty of people live perfectly happy lives without sexual intimacy, few people live happy lives when obsessed with the idea that they are damned.</p><p name="126e" id="126e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Fully internalizing the understanding that women are people defeats both of these, but we can hardly expect women to reach out and become intimate and vulnerable with men who have such warped conceptions of them. And, as we have seen, changes to media depictions often do not reach these men once they are no longer children: instead, they reject these changes as nefarious conspiracies, and sometimes respond violently.</p></div></div></section>
