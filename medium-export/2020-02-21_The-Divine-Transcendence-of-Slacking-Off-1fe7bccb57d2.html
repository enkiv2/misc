As Graeber Notes:</p><blockquote name="6dec" id="6dec" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">In Athens […] [t]he language of money, debt, and finance provided powerful — and ultimately irresistible — ways to think about moral problems. Much as in Vedic India, people started talking about life as a debt to the gods, of obligation as debts, about literal debts of honor, of debt as sin and of vengeance as debt collection.</blockquote><blockquote name="61c0" id="61c0" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">- David Graeber, </em>Debt: The First 5,000 Years<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">, page 195</em></blockquote><p name="201c" id="201c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">As slack is an escape from strict economic accounting of interpersonal debts, and since debt maps pretty well onto moral and ethical concerns, it’s natural to extend one’s idea of slack into all domains of interpersonal interaction. We can argue that the reason why parents do not, on their childrens’ 18th birthdays, present them with a bill for the cost of being born is that birth and childhood is a zone of slack. Likewise, an anecdote in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Thinking Fast and Slow</em>, wherein the owners of a day care are surprised to find that a fine for late pick-ups actually increased late pick-ups, can be attributed to differences in how people treat slack-oriented informal areas of interchange versus more formal economic arrangements.</p><p name="913a" id="913a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It should not then be surprising that at least one religious tradition took slack as its transcendental value. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Church of the Subgenius</em>, while remaining a parody religion, nevertheless (like most parody religions with fifty year staying power) presents an interesting and more-or-less coherent moral philosophy</strong>, and it is a useful foil for more conventional religious conceptions of moral obligation.</p><figure name="075c" id="075c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*fy8UHpHMq0HijIm-" data-width="1248" data-height="599" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fy8UHpHMq0HijIm-"></figure><p name="ecf6" id="ecf6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Church of the Subgenius</em> venerates <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“BOB”</strong>, an obvious con-artist, and consciously mirrors pyramid schemes and cults with graded initiations (like Scientology); its $35 bible promises “eternal salvation or triple your money back” through the accumulation of SLACK, but <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">this book does not clearly indicate what SLACK is</strong> (other than “something for nothing”) or how to get it. The implication is that, like a pyramid scheme or one of the content marketing scams that proliferate on the web, the way to get SLACK is to sell promises of it to your friends and family — for $35, eternal salvation or triple your money back.</p><p name="570d" id="570d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not merely a gag.

Both Christians and Buddhists are expected to turn the other cheek, but Christians are expected to only hold no sin-debt in order to get into heaven (subject to complications like purgatory and caveats like predestination) while for a Buddhist to attain permanent freedom from the cycle of rebirth, they are expected to also hold no sin-credit.</p><p name="47ab" id="47ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of this is because Buddhism is very much aware of the hedonic treadmill. “Life is suffering” because no matter how good something feels in the moment, it can never provide permanent bliss, and nothing (when observed sufficiently carefully) is actually as good as you would expect it to be. In other words, the difference between a karmic credit and a karmic debt is fuzzy, even on the level of an individual person; to eliminate karmic debts involves opting out of the entire system.</p><p name="df17" id="df17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Christian sin economy is a neoliberal one: ride the bubble, and hope that Lord State will forgive your debts when you crash. (Theological complications exist, and actually-existing Christians do not necessarily follow this logic.) The Buddhist sin economy is mercantile: isolate yourself from outside trade because being prosperous isn’t worth becoming a target. (Again, theological complications exist, neither I nor Zizek are authorities on Buddhism, and I know from experience that most Buddhists do not follow this logic.) Both are attempts to exit from the ramifications of transactionality without abandoning the logic of transactionality.</p><p name="730c" id="730c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The SLACK economy is different — more akin to book-hoarding or insider-trading, but ultimately (and critically for its popularity) most similar to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">hiding your activities from your boss at work</em>. Obtaining SLACK is not engaging in leisure activities (which, ideally, are divorced from productive concerns) but <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">engaging in activities whose productive status cannot yet be measured</em>. Bullshit jobs are high-slack, but because they are structurally incapable of holding meaning, the possible future productivity produced by slack cannot benefit the employers of people who are in bullshit jobs; instead, the possibilities explode out in other, unexpected directions (such as the invention of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithkuil" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithkuil" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the constructed languages Ithkuil and Ilakash</a> by <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/12/24/utopian-for-beginners" data-href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/12/24/utopian-for-beginners" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a New Mexico DMV employee</a>).</p><p name="d1f8" id="d1f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The productivity of slack is unknown, because slack cannot be itemized. This protects slack from distortion: since the labor encapsulated in slack cannot have its utility measured, it cannot be made a proxy for some other goal, and therefore it can neither be incentivized nor disincentivized directly (except in the original management context, wherein the entire pool of slack is minimized).</p><div name="522c" id="522c" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p"><a href="https://medium.com/@enkiv2/repent-stay-home-slack-off-3de0d32b96cd" data-href="https://medium.com/@enkiv2/repent-stay-home-slack-off-3de0d32b96cd" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://medium.com/@enkiv2/repent-stay-home-slack-off-3de0d32b96cd"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">REPENT!

Economic financialization — the domain of speculation &amp; other kinds of secondary markets around information — has a lot of attributes in common with slack.
