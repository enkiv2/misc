He wants you to look into his eyes.</p><p name="424e" id="424e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He changes shape. First, he sings a sad song, holding a starving puppy. Then, he is very excited about an upcoming sale. He is angry, and you become angry. He is afraid, and you become afraid. He wants you to have an opinion about the news.</p><p name="923f" id="923f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He wants you to become a goth today, and a punk tomorrow. He wants you to be a Democrat on Superbowl Sunday, and a Republican on Super Tuesday. He asks you how you feel about the issues, but he doesn’t want to know — he just wants you to feel something. He tells you about his new shoes and his old values.</p><p name="57bb" id="57bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He wants you to look into his eyes. He texts you at 3am asking if you’re DTF. He texts you at 3pm asking if you’re voting. He calls you in the middle of dinner to tell you, the Vehicle Owner, that a hold has been put on your social security number and thank you for choosing carnival cruises are you happy with your long distance carrier? He wants you to like his new vacation photos. He wants you to like his new starving puppy. He wants you to like his new eyes. They used to be yours. He wants you to have an opinion about his new conspiracy theory. He wants you to discuss it at 3am.</p><p name="ef53" id="ef53" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All the news that’s fit to print flows from his mouth. All the news that’s unfit flows from his ass. His fists are punching at each other. He wants you to look into his eyes. He wants you to have opinions about the news until it’s 3am again. He wants you to like, subscribe, ring the bell, and share his eyes with your 300 closest friends.</p><p name="a5da" id="a5da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He wants you to look into his eyes. He wants you to pay attention to him.</p><p name="b448" id="b448" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As long as you are paying attention to him, you are not paying attention to yourself.</p><p name="2d93" id="2d93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As long as you are paying attention to him, you cannot develop countermeasures.</p><p name="8bec" id="8bec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">As long as you are paying attention to him, you are powerless in the face of the moon.</p></div></div></section>
