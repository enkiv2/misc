They have too much influence to be able to take small risks in public.</p><p name="d43d" id="d43d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">A better model is writing contests. For a little while, I followed a publication that did a monthly roundup of open writing contests, and I was surprised to find that each month there were hundreds, mostly funded by small universities or foundations, with prizes between $25 and $1000 and restrictions ranging from “entries must be below 100 words” to “authors must be native american lesbians from rural Wyoming over the age of 65”. Individual contests have very specific biases, but each one is small enough that the total bias across all contests is kept small.</p></div></div></section>
