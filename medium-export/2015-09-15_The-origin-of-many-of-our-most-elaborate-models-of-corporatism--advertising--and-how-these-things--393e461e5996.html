They were equally concerned with modeling advertising and its subversion and with imagining a future urbanism where a post-scarcity city would see its primary goal as providing citizens with interesting and entertaining experiences.</p><p name="787f" id="787f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The situationists would say that we can only ever win temporarily: the spectacle sees those things that subvert it, consumes them, and allows the defanged and sanitized symbols of that very subversion to become a part of itself. Just as punk was stripped of its ethos, just as Apple took an anti-consumerist minimalism and turned it into a reason to buy more things, Disney and its cohorts will find anything that opposes them and wear its skin. Nevertheless, we can continue to subvert. The situationists were marxists — they believed that capitalism would collapse under its own weight, and (presaging accelerationism) believed that constant subversion would quicken the fall of the spectacle by bloating it.</p></div></div></section>
