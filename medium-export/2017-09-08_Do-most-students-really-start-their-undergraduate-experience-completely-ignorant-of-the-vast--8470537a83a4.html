The poststructuralist attitude — that socially constructed and socially enforced ideas are subject to power relations — is very different, and while there’s a lot of discussion about what ideas are accidents of culture rather than material or metaphysical truths, it’s enormously misleading to suggest that poststructuralists in general consider <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">all</em> truths to be socially constructed. This kind of straw-poststructuralism gets held up a lot by people who must have at least read some of the literature, and I don’t know how.)</p></div></div></section>
