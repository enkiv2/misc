What outsiders perceive as insane or weird behavior from North Korea has its roots in the past — namely, its near total destruction during the war. The lesson the country learned was to build as effective a deterrent and defense as possible, which is why North Korea spends 23 percent of its GDP on the military, a greater proportion than any other country in the world.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-09-11 1:36 pm</time> - <p name="3891" id="3891" class="graf graf--p">… (South Korea and Japan), both of which are backed by the full military might of the United States. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Pyongyang knows it is isolated and believes its Most Unexceptional defense is a nuclear deterrent paired with seemingly insane rhetoric.

Although implementation of the agreement was troubled at times due to mutual suspicion and the perception from both sides that the other wasn’t fully living up to its obligations, it mostly held until the Bush administration came into office, when hardliners were determined to scuttle the deal. John Bolton, then the undersecretary of state for arms control and international security (and, later, UN ambassador), used questionable intelligence that North Korea was developing material for nuclear weapons as an excuse to abandon the deal: “This was the hammer I had been looking for to shatter the Agreed Framework,” Bolton later wrote.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-09-11 1:38 pm</time> - <p name="fdc2" id="fdc2" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">South Korea has its own history of successful negotiations with the North, known as the “sunshine policy.” The sunshine policy was implemented during the liberal administrations of Kim Dae-jung (1998–2003) and Roh Moo-hyun (2003–2008) and involved greater economic cooperation with the North, allowing South Korean citizens access to certain parts of the North for tourism purposes, the building of a joint industrial park, and visits between family members who had been separated since the Korean War.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-09-13 1:14 pm</time> - <p name="2c42" id="2c42" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">I’ve used such a large number of pseudonyms over the years mostly because of how Amazon works. The majority of my published work is non-fiction. I think it would be weird, as a book shopper, to click on somebody’s non-fiction book on, say, spirituality, and have the “more from this author” section filled with cookbooks and practical how-to’s. It does not create the impression of an expert in the field. Readers would scratch their heads and buy a title by somebody they perceive to be more “focused.” I probably would. So it always made sense to separate my writing in different genres by using different names, if only for technical reasons.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-09-13 1:27 pm</time> - <p name="5258" id="5258" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">People who suck at their jobs never feel the pang of self-doubt, at least as far as I can see.</span> Let me tell you about this one guy in my PhD program.

Lynch was distraught that, as far as the TV series had left it, the unspeakable cruelty visited upon Laura (and Ronette, and others) was just a spooky footnote on the Twin Peaks legacy.
