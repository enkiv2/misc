What outsiders perceive as insane or weird behavior from North Korea has its roots in the past — namely, its near total destruction during the war. The lesson the country learned was to build as effective a deterrent and defense as possible, which is why North Korea spends 23 percent of its GDP on the military, a greater proportion than any other country in the world.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-09-11 1:36 pm</time> - <p name="3891" id="3891" class="graf graf--p">… (South Korea and Japan), both of which are backed by the full military might of the United States. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Pyongyang knows it is isolated and believes its Most Unexceptional defense is a nuclear deterrent paired with seemingly insane rhetoric.

Although implementation of the agreement was troubled at times due to mutual suspicion and the perception from both sides that the other wasn’t fully living up to its obligations, it mostly held until the Bush administration came into office, when hardliners were determined to scuttle the deal. John Bolton, then the undersecretary of state for arms control and international security (and, later, UN ambassador), used questionable intelligence that North Korea was developing material for nuclear weapons as an excuse to abandon the deal: “This was the hammer I had been looking for to shatter the Agreed Framework,” Bolton later wrote.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-09-11 1:38 pm</time> - <p name="fdc2" id="fdc2" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">South Korea has its own history of successful negotiations with the North, known as the “sunshine policy.” The sunshine policy was implemented during the liberal administrations of Kim Dae-jung (1998–2003) and Roh Moo-hyun (2003–2008) and involved greater economic cooperation with the North, allowing South Korean citizens access to certain parts of the North for tourism purposes, the building of a joint industrial park, and visits between family members who had been separated since the Korean War.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-09-13 1:41 pm</time> - <p name="23be" id="23be" class="graf graf--p">…m to solve Laura’s murder during season 2, fucking off to go write/produce the baffling <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">On the Air</em>. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">He gave up on <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Twin Peaks</em> not only because the creative concept hinged on Laura’s mystery lingering throughout the series, but because this boneheaded move busted his entire artistic vision for how the show would convey his underlying message — slowly and insidiously.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-09-13 1:42 pm</time> - <p name="8a74" id="8a74" class="graf graf--p">…use — because nobody wants to believe these things are happening just next door.

When you press your foot down on your car’s accelerator, for instance, you’re no longer controlling anything directly; there’s no mechanical link from the pedal to the throttle. Instead, you’re issuing a command to a piece of software that decides how much air to give the engine. The car is a computer you can sit inside of. The steering wheel and pedals might as well be keyboard keys.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-09-27 8:37 pm</time> - <p name="153f" id="153f" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">“The problem is that software engineers don’t understand the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">problem</em> they’re trying to solve, and don’t care to,” says Leveson, the MIT software-safety expert.

Languages such as Java, C++, and even Python seem to think that “object-oriented” means mostly “classes and inheritance.” Which is sort of like saying that “driving” means mostly “buttons and pedals.” What most of these languages seem to miss is that Smalltalk’s class system, like Lisp’s macro system, is a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">symptom</em> of the power already available in the language, not its cause.

What’s more, this projected path was reactive: When Victor changed the game’s parameters, now controlled by a quick drag of the mouse, the path’s shape changed. It was like having a god’s-eye view of the game. The whole problem had been reduced to playing with different parameters, as if adjusting levels on a stereo receiver, until you got Mario to thread the needle. With the right interface, it was almost as if you weren’t working with code at all; you were manipulating the game’s behavior directly.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-09-28 11:49 am</time> - <p name="c0c6" id="c0c6" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">But seeing the impact that his talk ended up having, Bret Victor was disillusioned. “A lot of those things seemed like misinterpretations of what I was saying,” he said later.
