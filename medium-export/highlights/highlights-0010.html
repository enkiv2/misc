But more than that, speedrunners actively seek out and recreate glitches over and over again; there is perhaps no other corner of the internet that features the glitch so frequently and with so much reverence as the speedrunning community.

If certain (neurological) pleasures are being deployed in a technology designed to fragment worker solidarity and ensure that a working class remains uncritical of their workplaces, that is even more scary to me.
