But more than that, speedrunners actively seek out and recreate glitches over and over again; there is perhaps no other corner of the internet that features the glitch so frequently and with so much reverence as the speedrunning community. Glitches, while technically defined as a “malfunction”, especially of a piece of software, become extremely valuable to speedrunners.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2018-05-14 1:21 pm</time> - <p name="fa04" id="fa04" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">The key realization here is that any bit of evidence (such as your friend saying “cool hair”) is evidence for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">more than one hypothesis. </em>Most of the time, most people have a single model for any given situation, and they hold up every piece of new evidence against that model, and if it’s not actively contradictory, they take that as incremental confirmation that their model is correct (cf. confirmation bias).</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2018-05-14 1:22 pm</time> - <p name="5213" id="5213" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">But this leaves out the fact that it’s consistent and coherent to imagine your friend saying “cool hair” in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">both </em>universes where your hair is cool <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">and</em> in universes where it isn’t.

If certain (neurological) pleasures are being deployed in a technology designed to fragment worker solidarity and ensure that a working class remains uncritical of their workplaces, that is even more scary to me.

The incel community that exists today on reddit, 4chan, and incel.me is an inchoate and ever-evolving group, which seems to change shape with every attempt to characterize it.
