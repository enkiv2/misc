So, the salient question then becomes whether we can create sustainable social and economic systems that self-select for the traits that we actually want in our leaders and fellow citizens.

It is nature, gift of the gods, the gods that are society. Lullaby’s dissertation dealt with how Mesopotamia lacked religion, lacked a word for it, as it was not a separate sphere of the people’s lifeworld. It was what was — that, undifferent, and nothing less. There is a poetic simplicity in that, leaving normalities unnamed for future historians to bother, but the pervasiveness of systems insists they never be tolerated as invisible. That which affects you and you partake of should be sometimes praised, always scrutinised, and often condemned. Give it a name and make it respond to your angered voice. Our society is rife with these assigned, cover-up values, though more in number are wonders hidden between us. Maybe this is why Enlil-bana attracts her, his story fills her with a presence: a simple gardener tending to succulent fruit who bumbled his way into being a king, who loved beauty over gold.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-11-6 9:47 pm</time> - <p name="32f4" id="32f4" class="graf graf--p">Once again, <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">the view numbers of these videos must be taken under serious advisement. A huge number of these videos are essentially created by bots and viewed by bots, and even commented on by bots. That is a whole strange world in and of itself. But it shouldn’t obscure that there are also many actual children, plugged into iphones and tablets, watching these over and over again — in part accounting for the inflated view numbers — learning to type basic search terms into the browser, or simply mashing the sidebar to bring up another video.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-11-6 9:49 pm</time> - <p name="4d0f" id="4d0f" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">We’ve encountered pretty clear examples of the disturbing outcomes of full automation before — some of which have been thankfully leavened with a dark kind of humour, others not so much. Much has been made of the algorithmic interbreeding of stock photo libraries and on-demand production of everything from tshirts to coffee mugs to infant onesies and cell phone covers. The above example, available until recently on Amazon, is one such case, and the story of how it came to occur is fascinating and weird but essentially comprehensible. Nobody set out to create phone cases with drugs and medical equipment on them, it was just a deeply weird mathematical/probabalistic outcome. The fact that it took a while to notice might ring some alarm bells however.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-11-6 9:51 pm</time> - <p name="c9a1" id="c9a1" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">What I will argue, on the basis of these cases and of those I’m going to describe further, is that the scale and logic of the system is complicit in these outputs, and requires us to think through their implications.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-11-6 9:52 pm</time> - <p name="2e1e" id="2e1e" class="graf graf--p">…ily’ in an incognito browser window (i.e. it should not have been influenced by previous searches). <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">This automation takes us to very, very strange places, and at this point the rabbithole is so deep that it’s impossible to know how such a thing came into being.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-11-6 9:53 pm</time> - <p name="580b" id="580b" class="graf graf--p">…frankly no more than the Surprise Egg videos or anything else kids watch.
