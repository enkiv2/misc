Customers have to be able to know what they are buying, what the consequences of their decisions are, and must have meaningful choices as to what to spend their money on. In particular, Smith’s theory envisioned an economic landscape consisting of many small competitors — not an oligopoly where there are a few giant companies controlling broad swathes of the market. And Smith never anticipated supply chains so complex that no single person could begin to grasp the consequences of a given purchase.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2018-03-19 3:05 pm</time> - <p name="af39" id="af39" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">The purpose of government regulation, then, is to supply the missing parts of the corporate fitness function.
