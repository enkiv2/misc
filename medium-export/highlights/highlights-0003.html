What’s more, this projected path was reactive: When Victor changed the game’s parameters, now controlled by a quick drag of the mouse, the path’s shape changed. It was like having a god’s-eye view of the game. The whole problem had been reduced to playing with different parameters, as if adjusting levels on a stereo receiver, until you got Mario to thread the needle. With the right interface, it was almost as if you weren’t working with code at all; you were manipulating the game’s behavior directly.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-09-28 11:49 am</time> - <p name="c0c6" id="c0c6" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">But seeing the impact that his talk ended up having, Bret Victor was disillusioned. “A lot of those things seemed like misinterpretations of what I was saying,” he said later. He knew something was wrong when people began to invite him to conferences to talk about programming tools. “Everyone thought I was interested in programming environments,” he said. Really he was interested in how people see and understand systems — as he puts it, in the “visual representation of dynamic behavior.” Although code had increasingly become the tool of choice for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">creating </em>dynamic behavior, it remained one of the Vaguely Unpleasant tools for understanding it. The point of “Inventing on Principle” was to show that you could mitigate that problem by making the connection between a system’s behavior and its code immediate.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-09-28 12:00 pm</time> - <p name="ec67" id="ec67" class="graf graf--p">… scale of millions of requests per second,” he wrote in a paper. “That human fallibility means that <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">some of the more subtle, dangerous bugs turn out to be errors in design; the code faithfully implements the intended design, but the design fails to correctly handle a particular ‘rare’ scenario.</span>”</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-09-28 12:02 pm</time> - <p name="baaa" id="baaa" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Lamport sees this failure to think mathematically about what they’re doing as the problem of modern software development in a nutshell: The stakes keep rising, but programmers aren’t stepping up — they haven’t developed the chops required to handle increasingly complex problems. “In the 15th century,” he said, “people used to build cathedrals without knowing calculus, and nowadays I don’t think you’d <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">allow</em> anyone to build a cathedral without knowing calculus. And I would hope that after some suitably long period of time, people won’t be allowed to write programs if they don’t understand these simple things.”</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-09-28 12:10 pm</time> - <p name="011d" id="011d" class="graf graf--p">Yet affective empathy and cognitive empathy rarely exist in isolation. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">In the context of emotional labor, people often first feel — use affective empathy to notice — that an opportunity exists to affect someone else’s emotions, and then use cognitive empathy to figure out what to do. And when cognitive empathy fails us we may fall back on affectively informed actions.

Those incomplete novels always seem to be drawing us toward meaning, toward completion, but then stop short, endlessly frustrating our desire for some kind of ending, so the fact that Kafka never managed to finish them is oddly appropriate. Modernism is all about incompletion, and many modernists have been considered great writers in spite of (or rather, because of) their incompleteness</span>, something that is very clearly present with Pessoa.</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-09-29 9:41 pm</time> - <p name="ffca" id="ffca" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Accurate quotation is not journalism.
