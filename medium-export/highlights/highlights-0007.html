Using the rope barrier, as I’ve seen at some department stores, only the most brazen of line jumpers would move ahead of a customer. The rope barrier would convince people they were being given the next possible place in line. As they worked their way through the queue, they would find themselves at the end of the queue waiting for one of the open registers to light up for them. The queue could feed into 1 register or 6, depending on how backed up the line got and how well-staffed the store was. However, the store would have less time per customer to sell us high-margin items like magazines, candies, soft-drinks, and batteries. Also, the additional queue space, especially if they lined it with high-margin impulse purchases to negate the opportunity cost lost by candy-lined little lines, would presumably take away from floor space they rent to other vendors, allowing those vendors to stock their shelves with so many types of alternate sandwich spreads that your mind kind of melts while you look at it, leaving you and your cart completely obstructing the bread and sandwich aisle. Vendor shelf-space rent is a sure thing; it is not guaranteed I’ll pick up a tabloid (“Oprah is from Venus!”) or a candy bar (“Cavity-Filling Caramels!”).</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2018-02-21 4:13 pm</time> - <p name="8bc9" id="8bc9" class="graf graf--p">…t spot — but deserving implies a fair system, and there has never been a fair system at that level. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">The illusion of a fair system at the level of employment at a major firm is what keeps some people going. It also keeps some people insisting that the heirs billionaires deserve to inherit money without taxes, leaving the schoolteachers, the restaurant servers, and the mailmen to pay for the police, the military, the public schools, and the courts. All this is predicated on a fair system in which anyone can succeed, one which does not exist and which becomes vanishingly less likely to exist with aggregation of power in the hands of so few.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2018-02-21 4:13 pm</time> - <p name="e098" id="e098" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Conveniently, it has me asking the wrong questions so the system doesn’t have to worry about the answers.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2018-02-22 5:22 pm</time> - <p name="b1f8" id="b1f8" class="graf graf--p">It may also be useful to look at alchemy and freemasonry, here.

For example, each result could show or link to the “oldest” instance of this image — functionality TinEye provides — which would immediately reveal that you’re not viewing the image in its true, original context.

This leads to some complications if a part of the technology is surgically inserted and not easily upgraded. I still have the original internal component — the Nucleus 22 — in my right ear, which is supposed to last me a lifetime. It has become harder and harder for the increasingly sophisticated processors (external components) to work well with the relatively decrepit internal components. I sometimes feel as if I have a 1988-era monitor hooked up to a 2017 processor. One day I will likely go under the knife again because the processing technology has surpassed the electrodes’s capacity to carry the signal.

Just read the text rather than consume the multimedia presentation of that. Narrow the scope.

This requires developing a strong sense of how others think and where the differences in perspective lie. From an educational point of view, this means building the capacity to truly hear and embrace someone else’s perspective and teaching people to understand another’s view while also holding their view firm. It’s hard work, an extension of empathy into a practice that is common among ethnographers. It’s also a skill that is honed in many debate clubs.
