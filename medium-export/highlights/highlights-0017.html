Birth control advocate and feminist Kato Shizue (加藤 シヅエ), later one of the 39 women elected to the Diet, welcomed the ideas and experiences of the American women employed in various GHQ departments. While the American women did play a role in assisting Japanese women, it must be noted that their roles in inspiring Japanese women to fight for their rights is greatly overstated, practically wiping out the hard work of pre-war Japanese feminists such as Kimura Komako.</span> Months before MacArthur met with Japanese officials to discuss female suffrage, notable feminist Ic…</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-04-2 11:28 am</time> - <p name="2f29" id="2f29" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Female sexuality was also exploited and explored during this time like never before.

While some <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">pan-pan</em> girls were indeed forced into prostitution by socioeconomic circumstances, the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">pan-pan</em> later became a symbol, synonymous with Tokyo’s burgeoning night-life, of liberated sexuality in Japanese women.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-04-2 11:28 am</time> - <p name="e62c" id="e62c" class="graf graf--p">…et with more controversy than that of Emperor Hirohito’s involvement and responsibility in the war. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">The Japan Communist Party (JCP) wanted Emperor Hirohito removed and imperial reign to desist, viewing the imperial family as yet another indicator of ancient, restricting ideals. Japanese socialists were all for the Emperor to continue to reign, albeit holding ceremonial powers only.

W.G.
