The full probability distribution contains more information than a single label, so intuitively we should be able to take advantage of this. The authors give this example from MNIST: a training example that has high probability for both the 1 and 7 labels “indicates that 7s and 1s look similar and intuitively allows a model to learn the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">structural similarity</em> between the two digits.” (Emphasis in original.)
