Machine learning, for instance, can be used to tell a cancerous mole from a benign one. This “promise” becomes a menace when directed at the complexities of everyday life.

Lucifer defies authority to follow his inner code. Lilith is considered the “dark feminine,” perhaps in part mostly because it is a frame we are unfamiliar with placing the feminine within.

She may be dark but she remains a mother goddess. Alchemically, psychologically, synthesis is a process of union. To make way for that, there needs to be destruction.

Nobody fucks. Nobody eats. Everywhere else in the world fucking and eating together is the substance of actual love but not in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Love Actually</em>. The film loves stereotypes so much that it can’t even bring itself to deny the stereotype the rest of the world holds of the English, that they’re shit in bed and can’t cook.
