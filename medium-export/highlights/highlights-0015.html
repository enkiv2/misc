I have a different diagnosis. I think they are infected with latent and lazy optimism. I do believe that they believe a connected world is a better world — and I agree with that.

I often hear Facebook accused of leaving trolling and disinformation online because it makes money from those pageviews. Nonsense. Shitstorms are bad for business.

In populations subject to extreme conditions, where environmental influences loom large, the heritability of a trait might be lower. For instance, weight is highly heritable — about 70 percent, according to the research — but some researchers think it might be less heritable in places where food is scarcer. If malnutrition is widespread in a society, the harsh environment might blunt the influence of genes.</span> Another field of research, epigenetics, is investigating how environmental influences on parents co…</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-03-5 12:49 pm</time> - <p name="94d0" id="94d0" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Until science starts doing a radically better job of representing the full spectrum of human diversity, the results of any genetic research will come with a major caveat: “Does not necessarily apply to different populations.”</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-03-5 1:02 pm</time> - <p name="4b00" id="4b00" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Some of our discomfort stems from people’s tendency to look at genes as “real” in a way that other influences aren’t. But to someone battling with reading comprehension issues, for instance, the struggle is just as real whether the problem stems from genetic propensities or from having missed out on some critical piece of education in childhood. What’s more, we already have access to better predictors of individual achievement. It’s just that we apparently care more about genes.</span></p></li></ul></section></body></html>
