Films this imaginative and atmospheric are few and far between, and examples directed with such prowess rarer still. Argento really let his fevered imagination run wild, resulting in his most original and bizarre film. He managed to meld together the two genres he had already mastered: the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">giallo</em> thriller and the supernatural horror. For me, it was the climax of his career.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-01-28 9:36 pm</time> - <p name="9873" id="9873" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Facebook and its leaders are often accused of cynicism. I have a different diagnosis. I think they are infected with latent and lazy optimism. I do believe that they believe a connected world is a better world — and I agree with that. But Facebook, like its neighbors in Silicon Valley, harbored too much faith in mankind and — apart from spam— did not anticipate how it would be manipulated and thus did not guard against that and protect the public from it. I often hear Facebook accused of leaving trolling and disinformation online because it makes money from those pageviews. Nonsense. Shitstorms are bad for business. I think it’s the opposite: Facebook and the other platforms have not calculated the full cost of finding and compensating for manipulation, fraud, and general assholery.</span> And in some fairness to them, we as a society have not yet agreed on what we want the platforms to …</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-01-28 9:37 pm</time> - <p name="bebb" id="bebb" class="graf graf--p">…of the problem and would even have garnered sympathy for being victims of these bad actors.

After all, if failure is a necessary component of success, what’s there to fear? Students who feel comfortable with limited information and unknown variables are more prepared to tackle new ideas.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-02-1 12:56 pm</time> - <p name="3d6e" id="3d6e" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Just as pattern recognition can be a helpful tool in discovering the possible inner workings of a system, deconstruction and reconstruction allow students to demolish and avenge the systems they discover. Changing built-in systems and tinkering with “variables” are the basis of coming up with new algorithms for solving problems. Understanding systems is also inherently valuable — grammar and syntax underpins language, for example.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-02-1 1:36 pm</time> - <p name="5c68" id="5c68" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Another uncomfortable coalition you see in Spanish cities is the collaboration between A) the people who understand the state apparatus as a means of redirecting civil unrest it into channels that support the status quo, and B) the people who understand the state apparatus as one of the most effective levers in catalysing social change. In most parts of the world this is a boring argument between radicals and liberals, an endless ping pong match where each team claims to have the One True Strategy while the Evil Others are undermining the struggle. In Spain activists have made peace with this tension, courageously taking the reins of institutional power while maintaining the grassroots mandate and accountability.</span> For example: the most radical political conference I’ve been to was mindblowing not just because th…</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-02-3 7:26 pm</time> - <p name="544a" id="544a" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Purpose Washing</span>: Social Inequality and the Question of Taxes</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-02-3 7:41 pm</time> - <p name="5aec" id="5aec" class="graf graf--p">…deally want to be left to get on with their own particular work, without distraction — the “JOMOs” (<span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">joy of missing out</span>).</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-02-6 11:33 am</time> - <p name="4ef5" id="4ef5" class="graf graf--p">…resh kitty litter I spread for utterly crucial traction on the icey driveway of uncharted futurity. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">His smile was the nightmare in my back pocket</span>.”<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> — William Gibson</em></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-02-8 3:28 pm</time> - <p name="9aa7" id="9aa7" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">The collapse of communism in the other post-Soviet states, along with China’s turn toward capitalism, only added to the kleptocratic fortunes that were hustled abroad for secret safekeeping. Officials around the world have always looted their countries’ coffers and accumulated bribes. But the globalization of banking made the export of their ill-gotten money far more convenient than it had been — which, of course, inspired more theft. By one estimate, more than $1 trillion now exits the world’s developing countries each year in the forms of laundered money and evaded taxes.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-02-14 1:54 pm</time> - <p name="9192" id="9192" class="graf graf--p">Then, <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">one night on book tour, Strieber says that a mysterious man knocked on the door of his hotel room and told him that our understanding of global warming was inaccurate.

Initially, he began making these films as a reaction to the dominant thrust of French cinema at the time. Over time, he began to see an additional reason for working through genre: it was a means of representing the marginalized “on a noble, large, wide scale.” The point was never to make socioeconomic polemics or documentaries. The political act was not “liberal sentiment”; it was deciding who gets to be rendered heroically in the first place.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-02-15 2:26 pm</time> - <p name="e87a" id="e87a" class="graf graf--p">… with approval.

In Italian, you have pentacolo, which means “anything with five points”.
