Nowadays, that often results in superhero movies that are more concerned with pleasing nerds than telling a compelling story, as if merely seeing a fan-favorite character or classic comic storyline in live-action is enough.</span> (Looking at you, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Thor: The Dark World, Venom</em>, the second <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Spider-Man</em> and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Fantastic Four</em> reboots, etc…</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-06-10 1:08 pm</time> - <p name="c7bd" id="c7bd" class="graf graf--p">…72 Letters,” which transmutes Jewish occultism into an egalitarian science.

Individuals are free and responsible for their own actions; but they are not the sole causes of their own actions. Others are also responsible, if not morally, at least physically or socially for those actions. Moreover, the reverse is also true: individual ideas, choices, and actions, etc., have a causal power that extends beyond the individual into the network of social relations in which he is embedded.

Some therapists insisted that affirmations had to be credible in order to get through to the subject; no reasonable person would believe exaggerated self-claims, a point that Coué had also made. While Weatherhead agreed with these critiques, he also believed that the rational “traffic cop” could be eluded by two practices. The first was the act of repetition: “A policeman on duty who refuses, say, a cyclist the first time, might ultimately let him into the town if he presented himself again and again,” he wrote in 1951.</span> Continuing the metaphor, Weatherhead took matters further:</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-06-11 12:29 pm</time> - <p name="1dd8" id="1dd8" class="graf graf--p">…tal tricks demand even more of the employee, rather than the employer.

Immaterial theory always entails a leap of faith somewhere, an essentialist explanation of “that’s just the way things are.” This drives these movements or sects into becoming a sort of religious faith, more about identity than strategy. Any outside critique feels like a vicious personal attack, with those who already share a very specific set of views the only true revolutionaries — everyone else is an enemy.
