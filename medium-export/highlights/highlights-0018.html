Without this kind of analysis, we can’t hope to shift the balance of forces in our favor and sustain our struggle long enough to wage revolution.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-06-28 1:57 pm</time> - <p name="cc67" id="cc67" class="graf graf--p">…fascists, the myth was an ethnostate.

This fetishization is usually accompanied by the same dogmatic thinking that characterizes commandist sects. These commandists are the types who parrot the rhetoric of bygone revolutionaries without understanding the historical context in which they existed. By thinking dogmatically, they elevate their political theories to an abstract set of principles, i.e. an idealist philosophy. If we are trying to assess conditions through the lens of idealism (in the Marxist sense of the word), our assessment will be completely inaccurate, and we’re doomed to fail.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-06-28 1:58 pm</time> - <p name="94e5" id="94e5" class="graf graf--p">Even worse, <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">idealism of this sort ultimately ends up reactionary — every time. Immaterial theory always entails a leap of faith somewhere, an essentialist explanation of “that’s just the way things are.” This drives these movements or sects into becoming a sort of religious faith, more about identity than strategy. Any outside critique feels like a vicious personal attack, with those who already share a very specific set of views the only true revolutionaries — everyone else is an enemy. Context and perspective become entirely distorted, and other communists become the primary enemy, as opposed to the capitalists.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-06-28 1:59 pm</time> - <p name="88dc" id="88dc" class="graf graf--p">…xtrinsic and purely verbal” elements of actual leftism.

For one, there are a number of unknown unknowns that inevitably crop up during the code construction phase of software development, issues that were invisible to the design process and only come to light when you go and try to code the thing. These unknown unknowns by definition become known considerations when you’re reimplementing a working piece of software. This allows the programmer to account for them in more elegant ways than whatever solution was implemented on the first run.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-08-16 2:25 pm</time> - <p name="5a55" id="5a55" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Another benefit of reimplementing working systems is that on the second time around, you are more of an expert in building that type of software. Reimplementing a working piece of software means, by definition, that you have more experience with the necessary tools, processes, and thinking that lead to a correct implementation. This means that instead of just worrying about meeting the specification, you are able to hoist your thinking about the problem to the next level up; a sort of meta-problem-solving, if you will. This mind-space can lead to insights that aren’t possibly when you’re primarily concerned with the nuts and bolts of getting an implementation to work.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-08-19 12:26 pm</time> - <p name="fede" id="fede" class="graf graf--p">The threat of deepfakes for information operations is minimal.<span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection"> Generally speaking people do not engage in rhetoric to change their own ideas, but to build coalitions with other people. When presenting data to support their arguments they are looking only for examples that appear to discredit counter arguments, or that seem to support their own. There is no reason why deepfakes would be more effective at this than existing cheapfake techniques, such as manipulation of audiovisual media, miscontextualized and decontextualized audiovisual media, etc.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-08-19 12:26 pm</time> - <p name="6209" id="6209" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Deepfakes are a threat to information warfare because they can be easily exposed as false, a lie. One of the fundamental rules of information warfare is that you never lie (except when necessary.) Deepfakes are detectable as artificial content, which reveals the lie. This discredits the source of the information and the rest of their argument. For an information warfare campaign, using deepfakes is a high risk proposition.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-09-2 7:45 pm</time> - <p name="372d" id="372d" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">There are two kinds of norms — “mores”, which are norms that carry great importance (like laws, chat rules, etc.) and “folkways” which are norms about casual, daily interaction. “Mores” we understand well — rules should not be broken. Folkways distinguish what we think is rude or polite, and often in community development, this is overlooked but can plant the seed of unkindness when broken. That’s why, as a community dev, you <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">have</em> to mentally distinguish what you think is acceptable ways of your community will talk to you and each other.
