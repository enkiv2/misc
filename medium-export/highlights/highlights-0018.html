Individuals are free and responsible for their own actions; but they are not the sole causes of their own actions. Others are also responsible, if not morally, at least physically or socially for those actions. Moreover, the reverse is also true: individual ideas, choices, and actions, etc., have a causal power that extends beyond the individual into the network of social relations in which he is embedded.

Some therapists insisted that affirmations had to be credible in order to get through to the subject; no reasonable person would believe exaggerated self-claims, a point that Coué had also made. While Weatherhead agreed with these critiques, he also believed that the rational “traffic cop” could be eluded by two practices. The first was the act of repetition: “A policeman on duty who refuses, say, a cyclist the first time, might ultimately let him into the town if he presented himself again and again,” he wrote in 1951.</span> Continuing the metaphor, Weatherhead took matters further:</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-06-11 12:29 pm</time> - <p name="1dd8" id="1dd8" class="graf graf--p">…tal tricks demand even more of the employee, rather than the employer.
