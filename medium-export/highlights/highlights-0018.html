Some therapists insisted that affirmations had to be credible in order to get through to the subject; no reasonable person would believe exaggerated self-claims, a point that Coué had also made. While Weatherhead agreed with these critiques, he also believed that the rational “traffic cop” could be eluded by two practices. The first was the act of repetition: “A policeman on duty who refuses, say, a cyclist the first time, might ultimately let him into the town if he presented himself again and again,” he wrote in 1951.</span> Continuing the metaphor, Weatherhead took matters further:</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-06-11 12:29 pm</time> - <p name="1dd8" id="1dd8" class="graf graf--p">…tal tricks demand even more of the employee, rather than the employer.

This fetishization is usually accompanied by the same dogmatic thinking that characterizes commandist sects. These commandists are the types who parrot the rhetoric of bygone revolutionaries without understanding the historical context in which they existed. By thinking dogmatically, they elevate their political theories to an abstract set of principles, i.e. an idealist philosophy. If we are trying to assess conditions through the lens of idealism (in the Marxist sense of the word), our assessment will be completely inaccurate, and we’re doomed to fail.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-06-28 1:58 pm</time> - <p name="94e5" id="94e5" class="graf graf--p">Even worse, <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">idealism of this sort ultimately ends up reactionary — every time. Immaterial theory always entails a leap of faith somewhere, an essentialist explanation of “that’s just the way things are.” This drives these movements or sects into becoming a sort of religious faith, more about identity than strategy.

Reimplementing a working piece of software means, by definition, that you have more experience with the necessary tools, processes, and thinking that lead to a correct implementation. This means that instead of just worrying about meeting the specification, you are able to hoist your thinking about the problem to the next level up; a sort of meta-problem-solving, if you will. This mind-space can lead to insights that aren’t possibly when you’re primarily concerned with the nuts and bolts of getting an implementation to work.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-08-19 12:26 pm</time> - <p name="fede" id="fede" class="graf graf--p">The threat of deepfakes for information operations is minimal.<span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection"> Generally speaking people do not engage in rhetoric to change their own ideas, but to build coalitions with other people.
