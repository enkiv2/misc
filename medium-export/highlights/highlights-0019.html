For example, <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">in his study, Watts minimized the effect of a psychological trait called executive function — a mental process that’s involved in suppressing impulses. His reasoning was that this trait reflects a child’s general cognitive ability, and could be the real reason why patient kids do better socially and academically. But Doebel argues that children may need this skill in order to resist a tempting marshmallow, so ruling it out may also rule out any relevance of the marshmallow test altogether</span>.</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-11-7 2:17 pm</time> - <p name="5852" id="5852" class="graf graf--p">…e difficulties as adolescents, even after accounting for some other important childhood influences. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Based on the results in their paper, the marshmallow test may predict outcomes primarily because of social support rather than self-control: Children growing up in more supportive and trusting environments may be more willing to wait for rewards.</span> This converges with some of Watts’ arguments about the importance of a child’s environment in expla…</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-11-7 2:25 pm</time> - <p name="d0a3" id="d0a3" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“</em><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">A big reason why I started writing is I felt that fiction had stopped evolving.

They can, in essence, take large things and make them larger. But the average writer will get a marketing budget commensurate with what they expect your books to sell. That means virtually nothing for most of us. There’s a certain “chicken versus egg” loop at play. Authors think it’s a publisher’s job to earn them money, but publishers don’t see it that way. In their eyes, you and your book are assets at best and liabilities at worst. You’re a stock in their portfolio; you’ll either perform, or you won’t. They won’t market the crap out of you to ensure your success.
