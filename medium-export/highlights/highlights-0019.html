In these internal dialogs I attempt to explain, at great length, why humans behave the way they do. This includes discussions as to the nature of politics, government, art, law enforcement, and so on. As you can imagine, the function of these conversations is to clarify my own thoughts on the matter.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2020-02-1 11:23 pm</time> - <p name="aba9" id="aba9" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">What I enjoyed, rather, was the sense that the future was being built and was available for general consumption.
