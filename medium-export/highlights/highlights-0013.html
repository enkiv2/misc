Posts in a group, not unlike the newsfeed, are sorted algorithmically by default. “If you click on the group, it tends to be the most popular content, but it’s not the most relevant,” says Dana Lewis, a member of several diabetes groups. For example, according to Lewis, the algorithm might keep showing a post whose question has been answered. And it might deprioritize posts from new members that don’t get much engagement — ensuring they get even less engagement in a form of algorithmic ghosting. It’s not exactly a friendly welcome to a support group. “I don’t think Facebook has done a good enough job,” says Lewis. “They have a lot of room to improve.” A Facebook spokesperson noted that members can choose to see most-recent posts first, and admins see posts in their approval queue in reverse chronological order.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2018-11-13 1:44 pm</time> - <p name="6d1c" id="6d1c" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">The Occupy movement has long been criticized as lacking substance or purpose, as if it were just a bunch of idealistic college students and dropouts with great motives but no plan.
