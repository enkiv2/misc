Yes, I know it’s a commonplace practice and a simple way of illustrating your point. But cherry-picking tweets risks distortion by taking them out of context — violating their contextual integrity. And doing so without asking the authors for permission threatens their privacy by obscurity. So I’m just going to contextualize the remarks expressed there. If you want to do your own fact-checking, you can search Twitter. In my opinion, the added transaction cost, small as it is, makes all the ethical difference.</span>)</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2018-04-13 4:54 pm</time> - <p name="914f" id="914f" class="graf graf--p">…ms, constantly shifting policies, and questionable terms of service keep so many of us in the dark. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Perhaps getting Zuckerberg to publicly explain things that some of us find remedial actually helped improve other people’s digital literacy.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2018-04-13 4:55 pm</time> - <p name="0a8a" id="0a8a" class="graf graf--p">… was personally stunned at lawmakers’ demonstrated lack of ignorance of the law and legal concepts. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Even Ted Cruz, who served as Texas solicitor general, had little to no understanding of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act,” said Citron. “He suggested that Section 230 was adopted in order to ensure that online services acted like neutral public fora. That is the opposite of what Congress was endeavoring to do — to encourage private actors to block or filter content. And lawmakers took Mark Zuckerberg to task for their own failure to write the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA) to cover 13 to 16-year-olds. I was not disappointed by their lack of tech savvy but, instead, their legal ignorance.</span>”</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2018-04-13 4:56 pm</time> - <p name="95bd" id="95bd" class="graf graf--p">…ing fast and loose with the law is just the tip of the iceberg when comes to regulating technology. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">The loss of institutions like the Office of Technology Assessment has been profound and can’t be made up for by expecting members of Congress to develop expertise in technology. Outputs generated by complex algorithms might very well be beyond the scope of scrutiny by human experts. And, as has been widely remarked, innovation moves quickly, while law is designed to be a slower institution, steeped in tradition and governed by careful deliberation. Outdated conceptions of technology limit the judicial imagination and persist through worn-out metaphors that negatively impact legal reasoning in matters increasingly important to us now, such as robots, cyberspace, and privacy.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2018-04-13 4:58 pm</time> - <p name="1079" id="1079" class="graf graf--p">…e position, that members of Congress should be thoroughly lambasted, also has merits. For starters, <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">members of Congress are public officials and arguably should be held to different standards of discourse than nonpublic figures, who aren’t responsible for matters relating to the public good in the same way.

To respond that one is merely putting something out there, just kicking around an idea, is helpful when one comes up against forces trying to keep certain ideas from seeing the light of day, but not when one is up against a reasonable critic wondering what evidence there is for accepting the claim in question.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2018-04-17 12:31 pm</time> - <p name="cc3f" id="cc3f" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Technology and the fourth industrial revolution are having untold impact, he said, and it’s going to take huge efforts to make sure workers ultimately benefit.

Proprietary cartridge technology added an extra hurdle where other games could be copied on floppy discs or tapes, luxurious prints and artists’ editions of born digital works become the valued collector’s items, and now, various types of DRM attempt to ensure that even someone who has purchased a digital piece of media or software can only use it in approved contexts, condoned and controlled circulation. “Owning” a copy of a film, or a song, or a game has become a negotiation of these hurdles, and with the increased presence of biometric scanners in our everyday life (your iPhone now knows your face and your fingerprint) the future of games that only play for you is getting closer.
