But it is not <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">right</em> that it happens, not morally or instinctively or emotionally, and in that dissonance lies a world of subversion.

Educational relevancy is a big thing on CVs, and academic courses are selected for their projected productivity and job security. To instantiate this as a teen, who has already obtained all the necessary knowledge and skill, is a way of formulating human existence through productivity. They aren’t of legal working age, but they have already become their jobs. Embodying this, and forced to compete in a market, it seems almost logical that it’s their lives on the line.

While this appeased Getty’s copyright concerns, removing these features also meant some simple tools disappeared, which people could use to identify the origin and authenticity of images — tools which could help people identify “fake news” and misinformation.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2018-02-23 3:21 pm</time> - <p name="44ab" id="44ab" class="graf graf--p">…es.

Imagine right-clicking an image and selecting “find original image.” Or “find first use of image.” Google could even improve the flow of its current image search feature, so that if you right-click and select “Search Google images,” your results present that image within a much more informative context and offer features with far greater utility. For example, each result could show or link to the “oldest” instance of this image — functionality TinEye provides — which would immediately reveal that you’re not viewing the image in its true, original context.
