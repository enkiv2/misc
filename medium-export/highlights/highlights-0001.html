For three years, the small team they’d assembled tried to build an algorithm that would streamline the workflow of such an undertaking. By 2014, they’d launched one and given it the Orwellian name of the “Invisible Hand.” Odyssey was counting on the Invisible Hand to allow it to succeed where others like it had failed.

That means a content strategist is editing anywhere between 240 to 500 stories per week. The Invisible Hand is what keeps these editors from losing their minds, managing their workflow so they don’t waste time sifting through stories to determine what their priority should be.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-02-16 1:05 pm</time> - <p name="6455" id="6455" class="graf graf--p">…about how you build an ideal system as how it might be corrupted, destroyed, manipulated, or gamed. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Think about unintended consequences, not simply to stop a bad idea but to build resilience into the model.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-05-23 1:37 pm</time> - <p name="f3af" id="f3af" class="graf graf--p">…e such a niche better are generally all too obvious to anybody actually developing in such a niche. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Iteratively identifying and relieving pain points in real development work is sufficient to vastly improve a conventionally-structured language.</span> Cutting the gordian knot by introducing a wildly unconventional syntax that’s better suited for cer…</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-05-23 1:38 pm</time> - <p name="d8fe" id="d8fe" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Syntax is the difference between a tea spoon and an ice pick.</span> Rather than aspiring to being vice grips or duct tape, build a language that is exactly the tool yo…</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-05-23 1:38 pm</time> - <p name="1cb0" id="1cb0" class="graf graf--p">Tried and true / universally-familiar syntactic constructs. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">A language should not sacrifice the ease with which it caters to its niche in order to cater to people who don’t want to really learn it</span>, but instead should have a syntax that minimizes the effort necessary to solve problems within its …</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-05-23 1:38 pm</time> - <p name="1cb0" id="1cb0" class="graf graf--p">…rt necessary to solve problems within its domain and that corresponds predictably to its operation. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">If a language is syntactically similar to some other language, this similarity should reflect a semantic similarity</span> (i.e., a stack language is justified in looking like forth and a declarative logic language is just…</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2017-05-23 1:38 pm</time> - <p name="d29c" id="d29c" class="graf graf--p">Over-design / biting off more than you can chew. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Start off with a minimally viable language and determine what needs to be added from experience.
