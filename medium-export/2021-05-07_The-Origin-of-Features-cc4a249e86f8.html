We should actually be improving that feature to handle the use case that this implies.”</p><p name="754e" id="754e" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What use case does it imply,” asked the other project architect.</p><p name="9b13" id="9b13" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I’m not sure, but whoever is using it this way is going to choose our competitor’s product if we don’t get busy.” So, they passed the use case onto the project managers.</p><p name="7d6b" id="7d6b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“OK,” said the project manager to the engineer, “we have two weeks to implement a new feature to handle this use case.”</p><p name="e85d" id="e85d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What is the purpose of this use case,” said the engineer, “when we handle this behavior better in the happy path already?”</p><p name="11f5" id="11f5" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I don’t know,” said the project manager, “but the order is coming from the top with a high priority so it must be based on customer feedback.”</p><p name="f57a" id="f57a" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“This use case requires violating several assumptions made in our critical flow. If people are actually doing this, we should cater to them by modifying that step in the happy path, and merge it into the existing flow instead of creating a new feature.”</p><p name="ca92" id="ca92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So they made some tickets, and six weeks later — only three times the original estimate — their implementation finally passed all of its tests. The following week, it was launched to customers.</p><p name="be5d" id="be5d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What the hell is the purpose of this new feature,” asked the customer into thin air, “when there’s already a way to do this a lot easier?”</p><p name="8746" id="8746" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Oh wait,” the customer sighed. “No, that way is gone now. It’s almost like the way their competitor implements this feature, except worse. I’ll have to figure out a brand new way to get my work done now.” So he spent his entire afternoon working around the new feature, making use of awkward side effects of other features in order to get his work done.</p><p name="fe5e" id="fe5e" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing">“Our competitor has released a new update,” their competitor’s vice president said, “with thirty new features.”</p></div></div></section>
