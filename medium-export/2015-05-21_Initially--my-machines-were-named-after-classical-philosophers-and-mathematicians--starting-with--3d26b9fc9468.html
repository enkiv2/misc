However, Plato &amp; Aristotle died almost simultaneously, and I switched to a non-classical schema focusing on mathematicians with Descartes, Liebniz, and Hume. Currently, my network consists of: Vonneumann (the server), Erdos (my work machine), Hilbert (my smartphone — because Hilbert is associated with both infinite hotels and space-filling curves), and Agrippa (the chromecast). Retired names include Godel (the PDA), Cantor (a now-dead server), and Conway (a laptop, named after John Conway of Game of Life fame).</p><p name="768e" id="768e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">My girlfriend used to name her machines after historical figures she was indirectly related to (Isaac for Isaac Newton, Tesla for Nikola Tesla — both of whom died virgins but who are great^n uncles).
