If you’ve got ETBD in some language, then you can write anything in it (barring IO), given enough effort, even without learning any more features.</p><p name="8b27" id="8b27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some languages have a really fast ETBD — prolog, forth, basic, python. Esolangs often don’t even have features beyond the ETBD level (brainfuck and unlambda for instance).</p><p name="646e" id="646e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A non-programmer can learn all of brainfuck in ten minutes. They are now a minimum-viable-programmer. Nevertheless, actually doing anything in it is a turing tarpit, and this is true of any language when you get to ETBD status in it.</p><p name="7774" id="7774" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Having a fast time-to-ETBD is important for a language because you need to get there before the user is ready to learn anything else. Optimizing documentation for time-to-ETBD is important for the same reason.</p><p name="c1b6" id="c1b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The amount of effort it takes to get to ETBD in Java, C, or C++ &amp; the number of new concepts that need to be paid tribute to (if not actually understood) is a barrier to new programmers.</p><p name="68a9" id="68a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(Modern GUIs never reach an ETBD point except ones intended as languages. As a result, modern GUIs, as framed as programming languages, are essentially dysfunctional. Likewise, lots of systems are ostensibly non-turing-complete but have Weird Machines that allow you to glitch them into turing-complete behavior — like CSS or truetype fonts; since finding these features is not really possible for new users, it doesn’t count toward learning curve.)</p><p name="0d58" id="0d58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Minimizing time-to-ETBD means minimizing the amount of time, effort, and documentation to go from total non-programmer to minimum-viable-programmer.</p><p name="0dde" id="0dde" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I do not consider the web stack to be a meaningful improvement over other systems by this metric, unless you consider obtaining an environment part of time-to-ETBD and do <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">not</em> consider knowing that such an environment exists as part of it. Even then, home computers booting into BASIC and shipping with manuals starting with simple example programs are better time-to-ETBD in that sense than browsers — the time from first computer purchase to being able to write simple turing-complete programs reliably on 8-bit micros could be years (or could be negative, if the salesman at the computer store taught you to program on a demo machine). There are people who have been using web browsers for twenty years without ever suspecting that they could write a program that would run in one with a text editor.</p></div></div></section>
