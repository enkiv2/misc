Absolutely. Does it have problematic association with race? Yes. Does anybody doing real AI research even believe in it? Only if they are ignoring their own results! After all, even relatively general-purpose ML techniques require endless tweaking to even begin to be useful when applied to different domains, and this kind of tweaking is exactly what these folks do all day.</p></div></div></section>
