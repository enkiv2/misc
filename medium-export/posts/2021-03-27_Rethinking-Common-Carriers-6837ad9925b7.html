Then you are making an editorial decision about which ads to accept — not common carrier.</p><p name="ea3b" id="ea3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ask for subscriptions? Then you are making an editorial decision to exclude people who can’t afford your subscription fees — not common carrier.</p><p name="de5f" id="de5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not how this law has ever been interpreted, but if we decided to interpret it this way, we’d probably live in a better world.</p><p name="428d" id="428d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Or rather:</p><p name="5a84" id="5a84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not how it has ever been interpreted with regard to user hosted content on computer systems. Between 230 &amp; DMCA safe harbor, the focus has been on this model where if you make corporations invulnerable the freedom will somehow trickle down.</p><p name="5df6" id="5df6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But, from what I gather (from friends who worked in public access TV), this is exactly how it works in TV land.</p><p name="773d" id="773d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Public access channels need to be totally neutral to avoid liability, and part of that neutrality involves being commercially unaffiliated &amp; airing all submissions.</p><p name="35d9" id="35d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Meanwhile, non-public-access channels take their editorial role very seriously! If they didn’t, the lawsuits and fines would roll in at an even higher rate, and plus they wouldn’t make any money.</p><p name="5779" id="5779" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Internet-based communications platforms (first BBSes, then hybrid ‘portals’ like AOL and Prodigy, and then finally social media sites) are the only ones who get to have it both ways — maybe because of the expectation that nobody would ever run such a thing without profit motives. We know from experience that this isn’t true, though. Most social media sites in the world are people’s, like, two-user pleroma/mastodon instances. And even back in the 80s, while big BBSes often had to be commercial, most BBSes were not.</p></div></div></section>
