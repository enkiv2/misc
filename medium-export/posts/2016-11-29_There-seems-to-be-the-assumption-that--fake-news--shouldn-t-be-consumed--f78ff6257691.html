I disagree entirely. It’s fine to have a list of sites that have mostly “fake” news, because you should be critical of (and, preferably, perform some fact-checking on) everything you read, and having a list of sources for which you have reason to treat with more skepticism is probably a good idea — particularly since recycling stories without fact-checking is a common behavior among low-budget outlets, so you should always be backing up anything with some source that are not on the list.</p><p name="ca1d" id="ca1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(The Daily Dot does some quality journalism; I’ve been reading their stuff for several years now. They also occasionally publish pieces that are shallow or subtly incorrect — but so does the New York Times &amp; Wired.)</p><p name="8767" id="8767" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">You shouldn’t avoid fake news. In fact, you should go out of your way to read fake news. But, you should also go out of your way not to trust anything — especially things you already agree with.</p></div></div></section>
