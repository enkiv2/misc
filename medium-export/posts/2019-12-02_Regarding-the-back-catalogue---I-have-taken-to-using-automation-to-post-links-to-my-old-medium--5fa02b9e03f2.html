There must be a way to leverage this. I accidentally did, once: I wrote an ‘essay’ that was just a numbered list of things about epistemology and for a year, I got claps from users whose names were in arabic every day. Surely I tripped some kind of magic button that associated arabic numerals with arabic-speaking users &amp; it was spamming those users with my post in their recs?</p><p name="646e" id="646e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Be the mad bomber you wish to see in your men’s room.</p></div></div></section>
