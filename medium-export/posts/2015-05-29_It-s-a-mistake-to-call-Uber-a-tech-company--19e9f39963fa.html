Uber is a taxi service that uses legal loopholes to avoid having to give its employees the various benefits legally granted to employees. As a result, democrats and leftists in general are against it, because the core of its business model is circumventing labor laws.</p><p name="372e" id="372e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When Wal-Mart cleverly circumvents labor laws in order to deny rights to its employees, nobody claims that it’s justified by the technical leaps that Wal-Mart makes, but why? Wal-Mart has developed more new tech than Uber has. The answer is PR — Uber has decided to call itself a tech company, and thus, it has recieved the protection of tech company boosters.</p><p name="31dd" id="31dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">When a genuinely innovative idea is put forth, there is no problem with regulation because regulation in that area doesn’t exist — the area doesn’t exist, so it’s a non-issue. Drones don’t meet this criteron — drones are an old technology, with early versions existing as far back as the 1940s, and they operate in a regulatory space that is largely well-developed. Uber doesn’t meet this critereon, because as we mentioned, it’s a taxi service.</p></div></div></section>
