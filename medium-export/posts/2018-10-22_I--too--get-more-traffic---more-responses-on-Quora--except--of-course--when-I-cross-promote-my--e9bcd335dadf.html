Surreal comedy is impossible in questions, barring weird-twitter-style techniques; surreal comedy in answers will be downvoted as ‘off-topic’, or ‘irrelevant’, as though such things are meaningful criticisms of a fully-connected intellectual universe.</p><p name="1998" id="1998" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’re considering moving your current activity somewhere else, I recommend ditching the web entirely in favor of Secure Scuttlebutt. Scuttlebutt is a social network invented by a guy who lives on a sailboat in New Zealand (or, presumably, adjacent to New Zealand most of the time). Posts there are primarily meandering stories about the cosmic insights someone noticed while repairing their solar-powered chicken feeder, puns about the word ‘butt’, and photographs of people’s pet sheep and/or home-brewing equipment. One notable user scans and posts the funny pages from his local newspaper daily. It’s like living in a small town and gossiping with the neighbours about trivia, except that all the neighbours live in communes in australia, germany, and rural spain, and build twelve foot tall fire-spewing art robots made of recycled sneakers and scrap metal in their free time.</p><p name="b5e3" id="b5e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Scuttlebutt has substantial overlap with the fediverse, a different social network composed primarily of gay communist furries who collect forty year old personal computers.</p></div></div></section>
