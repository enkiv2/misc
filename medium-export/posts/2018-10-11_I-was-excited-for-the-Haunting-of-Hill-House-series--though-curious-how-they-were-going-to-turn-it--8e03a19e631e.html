The apparitions are primal &amp; surreal, &amp; have no basis in the house’s history — and the hauntings began as soon as the house was built.</p><p name="5cbd" id="5cbd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">In other words, Hill House is not a house haunted by the ghosts of former tenants but an accidentally-built machine for making people haunt themselves. It’s architectural LSD with a strong preference for bad trips.</p></div></div></section>
