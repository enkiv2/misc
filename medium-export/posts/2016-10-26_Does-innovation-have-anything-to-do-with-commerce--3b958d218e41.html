Not any moreso than anything else. Innovative ideas are not necessarily commercially viable, and commercially viable ideas are rarely innovative; the space of commercially viable ideas is small, isolated, and nearly fully mined.</p><p name="4eb3" id="4eb3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That said, I can’t agree at all with the idea that we live in a particularly innovative time. Most of the businesses that currently get marked as “innovative” are attempts to revive business plans that failed in 1999 (like Uber); the remainder are businesses that produce shoddy copies of the products of their technically superior competitors but make more money because they spend a bigger chunk of their budget on advertising to tell everyone how “innovative” they are than they spend on actual R&amp;D (like Apple).</p><p name="ef7d" id="ef7d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Genuine innovation cannot be easily productized, and as a result, it isn’t really compatible with consumerist capitalism. At the same time, it isn’t easy to mistake genuine innovation for the kind of imaginary pseudo-innovation that is produced by the con-men who dominate most industries. If you can’t tell the difference, you aren’t looking.</p></div></div></section>
