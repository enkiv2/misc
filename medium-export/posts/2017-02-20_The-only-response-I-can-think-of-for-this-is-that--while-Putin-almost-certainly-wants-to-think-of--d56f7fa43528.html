Every plan has holes, because there’s too much complication.</p><p name="46f9" id="46f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In other words, at the very least, we’re looking at a combination of planning (particularly, the construction of double-binds), improvisation, and luck. And, it’s not as though double-binds of this type are impossible to engineer: it doesn’t take a strategic genius, or someone with near-total political power, to produce them.</p><p name="a904" id="a904" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">(The other thing to note is that the weak spot in any strategy is randomness. This isn’t to say that randomness will always win, but instead that any system will eventually succumb to fuzzing if the fuzzing can be sustained for long enough. Placing someone unpredictable in power is dangerous simply because you never know how they might undermine your plans — but that risk is spread out across all possible plans.)</p></div></div></section>
