But, I dunno. I’m hardly a sociable or popular person, but even I have experienced fleeting moments of mutual aid. I expect these to become more common as the forces that pit us against each other weaken.</p><p name="7143" id="7143" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s the thing. Mutual aid is absolutely contingent. It depends upon people liking you, which means either you avoid acting like a shithead or it’s clear that your antisocial actions aren’t your fault. This is scary if you have a social-darwinian idea of the world or if you see most people around you as enemies. If you don’t think anybody <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can</em> like you, it’s hard to depend on them, and some mechanism of supporting yourself without depending on them looks desirable.</p><p name="898f" id="898f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a world based on mutual aid (which most societies have functionally been until global capitalism, basically because the reach of the state was limited), exile is a de-facto death sentence because there’s no guarantee you will be admitted into a new community.</p><p name="b0b9" id="b0b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">bolo’bolo tries to address this (which impressed me, to be honest) by synthesizing mutual aid with a rudimentary social safety net and free travel. But ultimately, any plan for an anarchist society is going to be built around norms, &amp; hoping those norms become popular.</p></div></div></section>
