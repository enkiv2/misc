Since this program grants a firearm license, current laws prohibiting felons from owning firearms will need to be overturned. (After all, most felons are not violent offenders, and even violent offenders have incentives not to re-offend. We shouldn’t allow prosecution to become a fig-leaf for preventing minority groups from defending themselves.)</li><li name="01f2" id="01f2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">Participation may be delayed for mental health concerns, but not cancelled. A jury of twelve mental health professionals, chosen by lottery, must come to a consensus that someone is not psychologically fit to participate in order for this delay to occur. The delay may be no more than a year. This is a preventative measure against the tactic, used both in the United States and the Soviet Union, of applying bogus psychiatric diagnoses to political or racial ‘undesirables’ in order to silence dissent.</li></ul></div></div></section>
