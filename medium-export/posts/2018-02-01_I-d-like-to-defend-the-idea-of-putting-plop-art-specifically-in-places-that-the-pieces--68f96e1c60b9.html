After all, when there is no clash, the pieces blend in and are easily ignored. (Just consider the nigh-omnipresence of modern art in the background of high-budget hardcore porn. Or consider the way you never noticed it was there until now, because fancy modernist houses go along pretty naturally with abstract geometric sculptures.)</p><p name="5f0d" id="5f0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of the value of art is in its capacity as an attack on complacency: a criticism of the arbitrary division and categorization of spaces, and a reminder that the world is fractally strange in ways that are neither easily summarized nor easily comprehended.</p><p name="2e37" id="2e37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Creepy Lucy does not successfully capture a realistic representation of people’s internal idea of Lucille Ball, but it provides another way of looking at Lucille Ball that’s worthwhile, and in that way it’s more effective than a more conventional sculpture. Having shock value (whether that shock comes initially or only later) is necessary, though not sufficient, for a piece of art to be worthwhile as art rather than as advertising or design, and whether or not the deeper meaning unlocked by a piece is intentional (or an accident of fate caused by lack of skill, poor materials, or bureaucratic infighting) is irrelevant.</p></div></div></section>
