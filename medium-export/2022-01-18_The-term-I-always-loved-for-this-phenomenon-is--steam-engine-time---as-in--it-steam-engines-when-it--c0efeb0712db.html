The zeitgeist is crowded, and generally whoever comes to the space with the most resources gets both the money and the credit for the new invention (regardless of whether they even produced any kind of independent work -- in the case of Apple, it&#39;s pretty common for them to buy the rights to existing research or hire someone who has already developed something interesting &amp; then claim to have invented it internally, for PR reasons).</p><p name="03ae" id="03ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As long as you&#39;re a product of your time, you&#39;re doomed to invent the inventions of your time. Much better to be ahead of your time -- following another track that your peers will double back on sometime in the future -- because then at least you will be remembered as having produced something interesting, even if (as with Ada Lovelace, George Boole, Thomas Bayes, and Ted Nelson) your ideas do not get properly implemented during your lifetime.</p><p name="a0c2" id="a0c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I&#39;ve written about this a bit:</p><p name="4dbe" id="4dbe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://enkiv2.medium.com/the-manufacture-of-steam-engine-time-9f83cd24a9b0?sk=b681feb80672ae0553423b2e9ac4e286" data-href="https://enkiv2.medium.com/the-manufacture-of-steam-engine-time-9f83cd24a9b0?sk=b681feb80672ae0553423b2e9ac4e286" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://enkiv2.medium.com/the-manufacture-of-steam-engine-time-9f83cd24a9b0?sk=b681feb80672ae0553423b2e9ac4e286</a></p><p name="9b7e" id="9b7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><a href="https://enkiv2.medium.com/the-wtf-awards-sketching-a-map-to-an-escape-from-steam-engine-time-1bc4bd29c2e4?sk=b339d023ab854da7d6c7c6962b0e806d" data-href="https://enkiv2.medium.com/the-wtf-awards-sketching-a-map-to-an-escape-from-steam-engine-time-1bc4bd29c2e4?sk=b339d023ab854da7d6c7c6962b0e806d" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://enkiv2.medium.com/the-wtf-awards-sketching-a-map-to-an-escape-from-steam-engine-time-1bc4bd29c2e4?sk=b339d023ab854da7d6c7c6962b0e806d</a></p></div></div></section>
