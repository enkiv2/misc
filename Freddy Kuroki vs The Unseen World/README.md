This is a hypertext game, and most (but not all) renpy files are actually generated by an extra compile step. Before you import this game into renpy, you must do the following:

```
cd game
./snippets2rpy.py
```

This will convert the data stored in `game/snippets/*.txt` into an internal database, calculate keywords based on TFIDF, generate all the interior links, and generate both the indexes and the rpy files for each note.

The snippet format is line-based and consists of headers, content, and tags -- conventionally in that order. Headers contain a known header name followed by a colon, a space, and a header value. Tags begin with an asterisk and a space, followed by the tag value. All other lines are content. See [this file](game/snippets/19520607.txt) for an example.

Some headers are meaningful to [snippets2rpy](game/snippets2rpy.py); for instance, the `Type` header controls how content is interpreted (with `text` and `audio` types processing content as text, rendering it onscreen based on type-specific rules and processing it to generate keywords, while the `video` and `image` types treat content as a series of paths).
