    shironeko "As for what they're using all that illegal secrecy for..."

    ai "So this hard-fucking-core psi research... What's going on, exactly?"
    "Shironeko turned back to her screen, evidently referencing a document there."
    shironeko "They take volunteers our age and put them through a battery of psi tests -- zener cards, ganzfield, et cetera."
    shironeko "Those that do poorly are sent on their way with hush money. Those that do well are brought back and are placed in a twice-daily training regimen."
    shironeko "They have their telepathic, clairvoyant, and precognitive abilities tested, with immediate feedback, for hour-long sessions twice a day."
    shironeko "This works sort of like that language-learning software -- if you have any ability at all, you will get better and better at accessing it."
    shironeko "They're given drugs -- slowly titrated onto them, over months."
    shironeko "A mixture of microdosed LSD (to open up the mind), benzos (to create a positive association with the regimen and relax any resistance to suggestion), and sodium pentothol (to enhance suggestibility)."
    shironeko "This is a daily regimen, so even though the doses are pretty low, addiction to the benzos eventually does set in -- a method for keeping volunteers coming back."
    shironeko "From the data they have recorded, it looks like they're having some success."
    shironeko "They're building on some of the weirder ideas from the CIA's Project Stargate: specifically, telepathically contacting aliens from other dimensions and asking them to look into the future or past."
    shironeko "But it looks like the burnout rate for volunteers who graduate to that level is pretty high. They've been doing this for twenty years, and all but one of their volunteers has lasted less than six months as a contact point for the aliens."
    shironeko "They start having chronic migraines, and then eventually graduate to strokes. Sometimes, they also develop intractible epilepsy."
    shironeko "This is... weird stuff."

    ai "You think that ex-Stargate people have been brought to Japan?"

    shironeko "They had all sorts of stuff about telepathic communication with ultraterrestrials -- that is, aliens from alternate dimensions or that rely upon natural wormholes for transportation."
    shironeko "Some people needed to be dropped from the project because contact with these alien intelligences was causing too much strain. Like, being subjected to such an alien thought process was causing memory loss and confusion."
