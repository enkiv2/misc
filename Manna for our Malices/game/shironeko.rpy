    shironeko "Well, I know it didn't stop when it claimed to."
    shironeko "Also, it was leaked early and pretty widely."
    shironeko "I figured maybe it was like red mercury -- you know, a piece of fake info that's intentionally leaked to make opposing intelligence agencies waste time."
    shironeko "But, apparently a lot of people within the CIA took it pretty seriously."
    ai "Makes sense. If there's any chance at all that remote viewing is real, you'd be a dumbass to ignore it."
    shironeko "I guess. I think it was sort of a waste myself."
    ai "Well, the CIA isn't the only organization that took it seriously."
    ai "There's a facility in this town that's doing something with psi research, and their symbol borrows elements from the Stargate unofficial patch."
    shironeko "They pulled a Paperclip?"
    ai "Huh?"
    shironeko "Operation Paperclip. Where the US brought in Nazi scientists under fake identities to work on their own projects at the end of WWII."
    ai "You think that ex-Stargate people have been brought to Japan?"
    shironeko "It's one thing to steal leaked ideas, but copying an unofficial patch is weird if it's a totally independent team."
    ai "That might explain why they were having trouble with kanji..."
    shironeko "Huh?"
    ai "Um, nevermind that. What you're suggesting makes sense."
    ai "Is there material that wasn't declassified?"
    shironeko "Lots. I didn't take it too seriously, though."
    ai "It's deadly serious. There's weird shit going down at that compound."
    shironeko "What kind of weird?"
    ai "Like Cthulhu coming in from a dimensional rip shit."
    shironeko "Hmmm..."
    shironeko "They had all sorts of stuff about telepathic communication with ultraterrestrials -- that is, aliens from alternate dimensions or that rely upon natural wormholes for transportation."
    shironeko "Some people needed to be dropped from the project because contact with these alien intelligences was causing too much strain. Like, being subjected to such an alien thought process was causing memory loss and confusion."
    shironeko "I dismissed it because the way they described the aliens was so different, but I guess there could be two kinds..."
