    ai "Hey, Mimi. Do you happen to know what this symbol means?"
    "I drew an inverted triangle with a snake in it."
    mimi "That's, um..."
    mimi "I recognize the components without having to look them up. The snake swallowing its tail is an ouraboros -- an ancient symbol of the cycle of rebirth."
    mimi "A triangle with a circle in it pointing upward is usually a reference to the divine eye of providence -- a masonic symbol for god as engineer of the world."
    mimi "Having it point downward... is weird, since inverting it is indicating, like, ending the world. But maybe that has to do with the ouraboros. Like, ending the world in order to rebuild it."
    mimi "Where did you see this symbol?"
    ai "Um... on a truck?"
    mimi "I sure hope I never meet the owner of that truck..."
    mimi "Lemme just double check that I haven't seen this exact symbol before...."
    "Mimi flipped through her red book."
    mimi "Nope! The closest I have is an unofficial patch design for Project Stargate, which has both an ouroboros and the eye of providence."
    mimi "But in that, the ouraboros is around the earth, and the eye of providence is right-side up and looking at the earth."
    ai "What the fuck is Project Stargate? Some kind of fan film?"
    mimi "During the cold war, the CIA thought that the Russians were researching ESP. So, they started researching ESP themselves."
    mimi "Project Stargate was one of these projects. Specifically, remote viewing. The idea was that psychic spies could watch anything anywhere from the safety of a secure facility."
    mimi "They had some early luck but later it was attributed to bad experimental design. By the mid 90s, it was cancelled. It was declassified a couple years ago."
    ai "Weird. And they had a patch?"
    mimi "An unofficial one. Most military groups will make one, even if they aren't given one, because it's like a symbol they can all get behind and bond over."
    mimi "They get made even when it doesn't really make sense. For instance, undercover narcotics officers assigned to investigate party drugs in the FBI had one that had a disco-dancing skeleton at a laser light show."
    ai "No fucking way."

    ai "So, Mimi... I wonder if you can do me a favor."
    mimi "What kind of favor?"
    ai "Do you know what these symbols mean?"
    "I take out a piece of paper and draw the symbols I saw on Kuroneko's books."
    "Mimi looks at the symbols I drew and then takes out her red notebook and flips through it."
    mimi "The one on the left with the six circles is the logo for the Order of the Seers of Sophia, or the O∴S∴S. That symbol with the three dots means they have, or claim to have, the \"mason word\"."
    mimi "They're a pseudo-masonic occult society along the same lines as the Order of the Golden Dawn. In fact, they claim that the leader of their society is the proper outer head of the Golden Dawn, and they also claim to be the true lineage of the Anthrosophical and Theosophical societies."
    mimi "Neither claim is taken seriously by scholars. Aside from an obsession with the early 20th century Russian composer Alexander Scriabin, the O∴S∴S has nothing to do with Anthrosophy."
    mimi "Instead, it seems to be some kind of cult created out of whole cloth by their founder, a former Soviet music student who currently goes by the name Father Nikolai."
    ai "The fuck is a pseudo-masonic?"
    mimi "Pseudo-masonic means something that appropriates elements of freemasonry. It's pretty common with western occult groups. Usually the elements they appropriate are things like graded initiation -- where members are given a rank and only told certain parts of the mythology when they go through a ritual associated with graduating to a new rank -- and elaborate oaths of secrecy (often involving cutting out one's tongue or having one's heart cut into four pieces)."
    mimi "Claiming to have the mason word is another one. Scholars aren't sure there even ever was a mason word, and all the groups that have it disagree on what it was. But, it's basically a string of nonsense syllables, and claiming to have it means claiming to be part of the lineage of \"true masonry\", which typically involves claiming that the tradition goes back to ancient egypt or even to before the biblical flood."
    mimi "Of course, freemasonry is actually a lot younger than that, and appears to have started in the rennaisance. But, occult groups like to claim absurd lineages as a way of indicating the kinds of things that influenced their ideas, and a lot of members look at the lineage claims as a list of fandoms rather than a serious historical claim."
    ai "Ok. That's very informative. Why do you know this?"
    mimi "Well, we have an Anthrosophy lodge in our town. I figured that researching Anthrosophy and its offshoots might come in handy for a story..."
    mimi "You know, if that rag did any real journalism."
    mimi "As for the one on the right, it looks kind of familiar but I couldn't tell you."
    mimi "You should ask Kuroneko. She's into all that occult stuff."
    ai "She's into occult stuff?"
    mimi "Yeah! Didn't you know? I don't think she takes it too seriously, but she's always reading pretty obscure western grimoires under her desk during class."
    ai "She reads spellbooks during class?!"
    mimi "You didn't know? You sit right next to her!"

    # XXX if we know about the photo but not about later stuff in that route, inject menu giving Mimi photo info here.
    # Specifically, we can choose to tell Mimi about the photo as "something about Aoi that she wouldn't even tell me"
    # And exchange it for information about something else we have only some clues about (like the symbol on the MIB van or the symbol on Kuroneko's books or the history of that anthrosophical lodge)
    # Basically: we tell Mimi that Aoi's parents won the Z-Prize in 199X, but Mimi says that nobody won it in 199X
    # Instead, a lot of participants and sponsors boycotted that year (including the hotel) because of protests because one paper was rumored to have been based on
    # human gene-line experiments. Then a bomb threat got called in before the ceremony and so everybody evacuated.
    # This makes Ai suspicious, and Mimi asks for proof, so they go to the science room but the book isn't there.
    # This event triggers a couple different flags:
    # * one that makes us able to hide in the science club room's locker after school and verify that Aoi took the book
    # * one that makes us able to ask shironeko about the 199X Z-Prize (like trying to get the papers entered)
    # * one that lets us skip school at the very beginning of the game by climbing out the window to go investigate in person at Yomiyama Poly's research facility
    # That last one branches out: we get killed by a guard having a smoke break behind a pole when we go straight into the employees-only area,
    # which opens up a new option to hide behind a neighbouring pole until the guard leaves to do rounds. We then go up against a keypad lock.
    # We inevitably get killed here but now that we know there's a keypad lock we can dare shironeko to get the combination (which will be randomly 
    # generated and then stored in persistent storage, so that it's unique to the game copy but the same each time we ask her)
    # Entering the code lets us enter the facility where we eventually find the clone racks. Aoi, who has followed us, kills us here.
    # Following that death if we do the same operation we open up dialogue trees that will allow us to get Aoi's backstory & info about the clones.
    # (But some of the info about the clones should be able to come from getting a copy of the paper from shironeko -- a proposal that probably has 
    # fully disconnected cerebellums instead of hypoxic cerebellums. It will be hard to explain the technical details of the cloning in a way consistent
    # with even yandere-mode Aoi.)
