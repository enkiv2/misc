# * one that lets us skip school at the very beginning of the game by climbing out the window to go investigate in person at Yomiyama Poly's research facility
# That last one branches out: we get killed by a guard having a smoke break behind a pole when we go straight into the employees-only area,
# which opens up a new option to hide behind a neighbouring pole until the guard leaves to do rounds.

# (But some of the info about the clones should be able to come from getting a copy of the paper from shironeko -- a proposal that probably has 
# fully disconnected cerebellums instead of hypoxic cerebellums. It will be hard to explain the technical details of the cloning in a way consistent
# with even yandere-mode Aoi.)
