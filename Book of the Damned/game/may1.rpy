    "She awakes on grass, something soft beneath her head."
    akane "You're finally awake."
    misato "You escaped..."
    akane "You warned all of us in time."
    misato "What happened to--"
    "Akane gestured toward the now shockingly empty landscape -- the grass they lay on now surrounding a strangely barren area illuminated here and there by popping coals."
    "A bit of debris crumbled and fell into what must have been the hidden basement. A scrabbling of little paws, then a black shape popped out, holding something."
    "As the sun rose on the First of May, 2012, Kuro emerged from the remains of the vanished house carrying Corto's skull in his mouth. He put it down in front of Misato."
    "On top of the skull was a single gold coin."
    "In the distance, a honking."
    "Kuroki's van pulls up."
    kuroki "Sorry I missed the party. I saw some of the fireworks as I was passing by, though. Do you girls need a ride anywhere?"
    "There was a general agreement that, yes, the girls needed a ride -- back home, or to relatives, or to school friends."
    kuroki "What about you two?"
    "Akane and Misato had by this point gotten themselves vertical and were brushing the dirt and ash off their ruined clothes. They looked at each other."
    misato "I think we're going to stay here for a while, thanks."
    "Akane laced her fingers between Misato's gingerly."
    kuroki "Suit yourselves! Ok, everybody else, just move the banana crates wherever to make room--"
    hanabi "... Wait... why are there bananas..."
