    # Opening animation:
    # we see a UFO with a windowed onion-dome top spewing sparks across the night sky, toward a mountain that obscures the full moon.
    # cut to a character image of KUROKI on the left leaning against a stack of books, followed by SAFFYRE and SEYTON back to back on the right, SEYTON grinning while SAFFYRE pouts
    # cut to a bunch of yomiyama academy students walking down the street (seen from behind). Some of the students have haircuts that indicate they are the characters from MfoM. Superimposed on the right is MISATO who is also facing away from the camera but is initially looking to her left, and she turns in the direction the students are walking.
    # MISATO fades away along with the students and the street, but it is replaced with a black and white tiled hall with pillar globes on left and right, an eye in a down-pointing triangle at the end
    # the triangle lowers as both it & the hall cross-fade to the house in sunlight.
    # all of the tenants appear one by one in front of the house, forming a happy group pose
    # the tenants and house move down as the setting darkens. in the air above the house, giant cats eyes fade in, and then above that, CORTO holding out his hands like a puppet-master
    # a book appears and opens, and "BOOK of the DAMNED" is written in it stroke by stroke in red
    # underneath, "by Double Mojo" in rainbow
    # "BOOK of the DAMNED" shines and then drips like blood.
