    comment "XXX Upon waking, Misato & Akane talk about the noise. Akane says (quote from Vampire Doll, re: old houses)."
    comment "XXX They hear noises elsewhere in the building, primed to be freaked out, grab ad-hoc weapons to check it out."
    comment "XXX It's Hanabi, Yuuko, and Hikari. Akane excitedly rushes Hanabi, hugging her, then introduces her. Hanabi introduces Yuuko and Hikari, who she met when their transportation stopped at the same inn for the night due to flooding."
    comment "XXX Akiko and Miko arrive, and Misato introduces Miko, while Miko introduces Akiko but does not explain how they met. Akiko doesn't talk much, causing awkwardness."
    comment "XXX The group talks about how Corto isn't there yet. They start helping each other move in. Hanabi has keys to various rooms, & distributes them. They work together to make a big meal, using a hot plate in a closet and some cans, and eat it while sitting on the floor in the nave."
    comment "XXX Misato sleeps alone, and again, there's a banging in the hall. She asks the player for advice."
    comment "XXX If she decides to check, she discovers the black cat (Kuro) hunting at this point. She asks what to do, & if she plays with the cat she gets points toward cat affinity & towards affinity with Kuro."
