# At 80% of the way through the runtime, this is the "all is lost" moment
# if she survives, then we have three days of planning before she can get the 'true end' april 30 - may 1
# if she doesn't survive then this is game over, so put a false failure at the new midpoint (april 5) and a false success at the new 80% mark (april 18) 
label drugged_scene:
# Misato is summoned to Corto's penthouse. She is offered tea, and drinks it, as he monologues at her. She wonders why she's here.
# She begins to hallucinate: her vision gets slightly fuzzy, she begins to see tiny figures marching along the edge of the teacup,  it morphs into a desert landscape, etc.
# If cat affinity is high enough, this transitions to a Louis Wain style of cats marching in, and Misato wakes up downstairs. She later discovers Corto has been mauled.
# Otherwise, there is a warped & delirious perception of Misato's violation and murder
# initially, with increasingly dark imagery:
# the desert landscape becomes a geometric garden (like Last Year At Marienbad), but the shrubs become wheels (fading into the final shot of Ken Russel's The Devils)
# then, fish and bubbles and a blur/haze overlay this: it is underwater
# after this, we get description --
# (extremely vague: shapes pressing on her, a warm feeling lapping at her neck as she feels like she's floating, followed by the game announcing her death).
# death is followed by tv static animation
