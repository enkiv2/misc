		comment "misato gets up, and hanabi & yuuko have already made breakfast."
		comment "akane shows up, in the same pink sweater as hanabi. misato is surprised, but akane says that it's her uniform from the school she went to in chiba with hanabi."
		comment "they all quickly eat their food, since today is the day when they start to go to their new school."
		comment "misato is disappointed to discover that all her companions are going to the municipal high school; she's the only one with the grades or cash to get into yomiyama academy"
		comment "as they are leaving, misato reminds them to meet up at the house right after school, since the cult has reserved seats for them at a lecture at the local university"
		comment "at school, misato is in the same class as ai, aoi, kuroneko, mimi, etc."
		comment "she is introduced, and is given the seat between mimi and shironeko, who has not yet appeared."
		comment "a few minutes after the beginning of class, shironeko shows up, preceded by a lot of muttering in the hallway. the classroom is full of whispering as she comes in, and she looks very uncomfortable."
		comment "the teacher brings her into the hall to talk to her -- presumably to lecture her about her tardiness"
		comment "misato asks mimi what's going on, and mimi explains that shironeko doesn't come into school very often and is typically late even when she does, which merely draws more attention to her than her looks"
		comment "misato says that, though she doesn't like to admit it, she was expecting to be the center of attention for her western features and is glad that someone else stands out more"
		comment "mimi says that in this school, since it's all girls, the odds are good, but the goods are odd. shironeko's younger sister, the honor student kuroneko, is bitchy to everybody; akagi acts like she's the hero of some gekiga; as for tomoe, the princess, well... blue is her natural color."
		comment "shironeko comes back in, sits down, and immediately falls asleep."
		comment "misato asks the player whether or not she should try to befriend shironeko. befriending and choosing to spend time with her produces shironeko affinity, which controls whether shironeko will help you / give advice later"
		comment "class curriculum: history (pre-unification), biology (DNA), english (reading selections from M. R. James), math (factoring polynomials)"
		comment "after school, she goes back to the mansion"
		comment "everyone else is already there, because the municipal high school is closer. they are investigating a flower patch near the edge of the forest."
		comment "there's discussion about whether or not the flowers are native... if they're volunteers or if they were cultivated, and how long ago."
		comment "the route to yomi poly is explained (we see a map)"
		comment "they walk together to yomi poly, chatting, and find the building where they're supposed to see the lecture. a yellow volkswagen bus is parked nearby"
		comment "they go in, & have assigned seats in the front row, left hand side, and other people file in after"
		comment "misato gets overwhelmed by the chattering minds -- we see fragmented bits of inner monologue intercalated -- and looks behind her. (audience.png)"
		comment "akane asks if she's ok, and she says yes, but then she gets another burst of chatter, and says she needs to get some air"
		comment "she run-staggers out of the auditorium and into the bathroom, where she pukes in the sink"
		comment "as she's cleaning up, two researchers in lab coats come in, talking about how culturing clones from umbilical blood causes testosterone not to have longevity-shortening effects on the cloned cells"
		comment "she excuses herself and leaves, passing by the entrance, where she sees seyton leaning against the building, smoking, and saffyre directing some workers moving boxes in and out of a white van"
		comment "she comes back to her seat, while the speaker is being introduced. the host says that the doctors tomoe came to yomiyama to investigate the unusually high incidence of twins, and ended up founding the tomoe foundation, which is the university's biggest donor and the host of this lecture series."
		comment "the speaker is kuroki, whose educational background is described"
		comment "kuroki gives a long and rambling lecture about language is a distributed socially-mediated world-model that itself influences perception and decision-making, i.e. a control system, and how poetry is a kind of magick"
		comment "he links this to vallee and to his ufo research, which he says universities don't like him talking about in lectures"
		comment "as he finishes, corto comes to the stage and saffyre produces a stool for him so he can reach the lectern"
		comment "corto gives a quick speech about how the space brothers would be glad to know that the earth has people as learned as kuroki -- during which kuroki, standing to the side, looks very uncomfortable"
		comment "corto leaves, and kuroki stays on the stage for some polite applause"
		comment "as kuroki leaves the stage, he comes up to misato and says 'my benefactor! so we meet again', but is interrupted by someone who says she read his book 'complete guide to mysterious animals' and wants to ask him about the green fireballs she keeps seeing in her living room"
		comment "he gets pulled away by her and the girls leave"
		comment "corto has already left campus, so they walk back to the mansion"
		comment "when they get back, saffyre introduces herself, and introduces seyton as her brother. she says that she and seyton will not be sleeping here, but that during the day they will act as corto's assistants as they have been for a few years"
		comment "she says that she will instill discipline and wants everyone to be in their rooms for lights out at 8"
		comment "seyton leers silently in the corner the whole time"
