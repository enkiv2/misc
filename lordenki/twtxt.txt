2018-02-12T08:47:24-05:00	I keep hearing the awful take that Altered Carbon is shallow aesthetic-centric cyberpunk devoid of social commentary. Did these people rush to skim the book when they heard about the TV show or something?
2018-02-12T08:48:51-05:00	The first book in the Altered Carbon series hews closer to standard hardboiled structure & is less 'about' resleeving but is very much about social inequality at scale.
2018-02-12T08:50:23-05:00	The second and third books are mostly about the political & social ramifications of resleeving technology over centuries. That is, after all, the point of the series.
2018-02-12T08:52:18-05:00	I feel like Netflix's adaptation did a pretty good job of keeping that social & political focus, and even frontloading it a little bit by injecting backstory from the second and third books.
2018-02-12T08:54:00-05:00	People make the obvious comparison to Blade Runner, but seeing as how Blade Runner is a famously shallow & aesthetically-focused adaptation that strips the social & political elements from its source, Altered Carbon comes out the winner here

2018-02-12T15:31:28-05:00	Social structure is a technology, but it's one that most self-identified techies are ill-equipped to debug, mainly due to bigotry against properly studying it.
2018-02-12T15:32:56-05:00	We're really bad at being dispassionate about non-social technologies, but even worse about social technologies (by which I mean: political systems, power relations).
2018-02-12T15:34:17-05:00	Of course, being driven by emotion, nostalgia, and other prejudices is a non-issue in emacs vs vi. But, in deciding how to structure power relations, it's huge.
2018-02-12T15:36:41-05:00	In an equitable society, social problems are a matter of individual choice. We don't live in such a society, and never have. If we want to, we should be honest about this. Pretending to have achieved equity is a good way to amplify shitty power relations.
2018-02-12T15:38:47-05:00	Optimizing for anything other than human happiness seems like a recipe for misery. Of course, no existing political system really seriously attempts to optimize for human happiness.
2018-02-12T15:39:59-05:00	There are legitimate open questions: should we maximize minimum happiness? Should we maximize mean, or median, or total happiness? But, no existing social system optimizes for any of these metrics or any combination of them.

2018-06-06T13:56:39-04:00	I should probably implement an example version of transcopyright for my repo of 'important data structures, algorithms, & ideas that have no easily-understood isolated example implementations' (https://github.com/enkiv2/misc/tree/master/ds-lib) since it's already mostly xanadu shit
2018-06-06T14:06:06-04:00	Actually, if I did a series of articles on (non-secret parts of) Xanadu internals, would anybody care? Not just transcopyright -- I've got detailed knowledge on how ZZOGL / FloatingWord did layout, for instance. I think I can explain these things in a clearer way than Ted does, in some cases.

2018-06-25T09:02:31-04:00	Hot take: the more powerful you are, the harder people under you will work to save you from your bad choices, & the harder they'll avoid actually addressing those problems. A perfect storm for inflated confidence: your continued success is owed to the people covering your ass, but you attribute it even more to yourself.

The best of today's programming languages make easy things hard and hard things harder. We don't have a system that makes easy things easy and hard things merely hard for backwards-compatibility reasons.

2018-08-16T14:31:20-04:00	This is a very hot take and also not a new one but here we go: the goal of a properly functioning software engineer is to obviate themselves, not by solving the customer's specific problems but by blurring the line between using a computer and programming one to the point where users can solve their own problems.

2018-08-17T19:01:46-04:00	VLC logic: doubleclick toggles fullscreen but each single click in that double click still also toggles playback, so toggling fullscreen causes you play for 1/8 of a second
2018-08-17T20:25:51-04:00	Translit is a little like bittorrent, if bittorrent used literally the same bytes for AMVs and trailers as for the corresponding scenes in the show/movie.

2018-10-30T13:26:39-04:00	Hot take: any command that a user might want to use regularly should be short, memorable, and built-in; any command that a user might really NEED to use should be documented & included in the examples in built-in documentation.
2018-10-30T13:29:09-04:00	Hot take: in the absence of full information, provide reasonable defaults that are easily overridden. Making users repeat normally-identical pieces of information several times just because they CAN differ in a corner case is bad design.
2018-10-30T16:51:33-04:00	Hot take: moral hazard is an information problem with its roots in systematic overconfidence & optimism bias. Either important domains of risk are ignored or the effectiveness of mitigations is overestimated.

2018-10-31T13:17:42-04:00	'Do you prefer horror movies or comedy movies' is a good way of phrasing 'with what degree of intensity are you comfortable having your mental constructs challenged'. 'Hausu is my favorite movie' is a valid & illuminating response.
2018-10-31T13:21:21-04:00	In one sense, 'the computer revolution is over' because the period of exponential growth behind the tech ended 10 years ago. In another sense, it hasn't begun: we have sheltered ourselves from the social and intellectual ramifications of computing. Documents are still simulations of paper, & capitalism still exists. So it's like that period where printing presses existed but everybody used a faux-calligraphic font.

2019-03-10T20:10:43-04:00	Other ways in which UX is like stand-up comedy: if you omit the setup, the punchline won't land; reading the room is a vital skill
2019-03-10T20:13:04-04:00	The typical failure mode of UX is no longer the shaggy-dog story (i.e., the turing tarpit: a lot of build-up for a disappointing conclusion); it's bunch of shallow one-liners with no connecting thread, which are as funny as they can be for their length but don't make the most of a set.
2019-03-10T20:15:08-04:00	A good user interface *is* a lot like a standup routine: you take the deep knowledge of an audience and twist it in creative ways so that they now understand something they couldn't have imagined on their own.
2019-03-10T20:16:15-04:00	Poor documentation is overrated as an attribute of jokes. (Some of my favorite jokes are literally humorous attempts at explaining other jokes.) The difference between standup comedy & UI design is even bad comics know this.

2019-03-15T08:57:05-04:00	Trendism is the idea that, in Dellio's White Noise, when people photograph the Most Photographed Barn In America, they are not acting absurdly but creating net value for society.
2019-03-15T08:58:52-04:00	Trendism is the logic of financialized speculative capitalism extended to the realm of takes: information about information about information (even if it's false) exceeds the value of the baseline information.
2019-03-15T09:00:08-04:00	Trendism is the logic of the Spectacle applied recursively: the image doesn't matter, but whether or not the appearance of its appearance appears is worth arbitrary millions.
2019-03-15T09:01:48-04:00	Trendism is a complicated inversion of the aphorism 'mediocre minds talk about people, and great minds talk about ideas': we value most those who talk about whether or not people are talking about an idea.

2019-04-03T13:37:46-04:00	What's the difference between poetry and prose? I'd say that with prose, one aims to constrain the set of possible meanings as tightly as possible to minimize misunderstanding. Poetry has the richness of possible meanings that direct experience has.
2019-04-03T13:39:15-04:00	If one intends to be understood, one must be careful not to be too clever: a reader will calibrate their cleverness based on their expectation of yours, & any mismatch is liable to produce misunderstanding.
2019-04-03T13:41:05-04:00	A depiction, if rich enough to be interesting, is bound to have internally contradictory potential interpretations. You control the frame, but the frame can't be as tight as in (say) an essay.

2019-07-10T16:26:34-04:00	Some vampires grow thick fur to protect them from the sunlight. Others move to the ocean floor -- the abyssal zone, where no light can penetrate.

Stakes merely pin them down; they cannot die, but being trapped in sensory isolation for centuries is worse.

2019-07-11T19:17:11-04:00	Idea for BotD: depending which route the protagonist goes down (i.e., which character she ends up falling in love with), the genre of the game changes. If she goes for Akane, it's a mashup of italian gothic & giallo sensibilities -- a neon-tinged haunted house movie. If she goes for the bookish Hanabi, it's a mannered Agatha Christie style mystery. (Facts of the case stay the same.) If you play all those routes, you open up the ability for her to go on a PLAYER ROUTE.

If somebody feels that the reason they're being shamed is flimsy or arbitrary, they're more likely to react by rejecting the group & its norms & finding some other group that doesn't share those norms.

2019-07-26T20:32:54-04:00	Making something meaningless is hard -- Chomsky couldn't do it with 'colorless green ideas sleep furiously'. When we say something is meaningless, we usually really mean that it means everything -- that the author has failed to cleave away irrelevant or distracting dimensions of meaning by introducing constraints to make them impossible in any careful reading. The problem of composing with language is the problem of making sure words mean exactly what we want them to, no more and no less, which is a form of constraint engineering.

2019-07-30T16:24:42-04:00	Hot take: web tech is fundamentally neither secure nor performant, and nothing can be done to make it either of these things beyond a pretty baseline level without breaking compatibility with... everything. While webtech lets you fail to varying degrees of hardness, it doesn't let you succeed, and beyond a minimal level of 'don't do obviously stupid things', attempts to make webtech secure or performant are like rearranging chairs on the titanic: you can get in somebody's way or clear it, but you won't stop the boat from sinking.

2019-07-31T06:12:30-04:00	In order to square the circle, we invented calculus -- which didn't give us a number, but a notation for representing exact numbers & a mechanism for flattening that notation to approximations of arbitrary granularity. Sometimes, when we try to metaphorically 'square the circle', the problem is hard because we have formulated the question in such a way that it permits only wrong answers, and we need to add a layer of abstraction to even address our underlying need.

2019-08-02T22:57:17-04:00	How much of the 'postmodern condition' can we lay at the feet of widespread literacy (& thus access to bound time) breaking the hold that time & geography previously had on most people, making it so that any community of individuals could have its discussion dominated by the recorded voices of diverse ancient dead (as opposed to some canon as filtered through a priesthood)? New electronic media mimic the pattern of literacy, but bigger: we record more of the present, & make the immediate past widely accessible, but the fog of war that kept 'history' feeling distant from present concerns has cleared to a greater extent, so that everybody living in the present can functionally live in a mediated & edited simulacrum of the past or pasts of their choice & carry on the lineage of whatever trimmed-off branches of retrofuture trajectory interest them. This is literacy writ large -- literacy when access & distribution of bound time is cheap and easy.

2019-08-05T13:08:11-04:00	Did anybody document the production history of the Avengers episode A Sense of History with an eye toward analyzing the politics? Because, it's wild. Like, in this 1966 episode, Steed & Mrs Peel travel to not-Oxford... to save not-Eurozone... from not-Mencius Moldbug. But also, everybody has french surnames that they pronounce in the most not-french way possible (Dubois as 'do boys'), and they dress up as Robin Hood characters and kill people with arrows and have some kind of masonic-inspired ritual involving blooding themselves with swords. And, the whole discussion about the meaning of history to economics, though its never actually explained, makes me think it's supposed to be related to Marx.

2019-09-26T06:43:43-04:00	real talk though, monsters & monstrousness are a realy important and powerful lens. 'monster' comes from the same root as 'deMONSTRate', because monstrousness was taken as indicating pathological/corner cases that demonstrate the edges & interactions of natural law. at the same time, monsters were associated with the juxtaposition of normally-non-coresident attributes (as with the chimera & similar creatures). in other words: monstrousness is a feature that demonstrates the laws of nature by extremes & recombinations outside normal behavior. even that part of the monstrous that is taken to justify our fear of it -- monsters as an Other -- is important & constructive in this way, since it is only by contact with The Other (sometimes the Other inside ourselves, hidden by habit) that we can grow, and this contact is dangerous since whether or not we grow from it, it forces us to change.

The two of you type in a final word, and if you match, you get a number of points inversely proportional to how common that completion is (initially in some corpus like gutenberg and later in terms of other players). There is no global scoreboard (to prevent gaming rank) but each player has a personal scoreboard for how many points games with particular friends tend to have. The goal of the game is to understand how your partner thinks in order to sync up with them, while diverging from the herd.

We need more movies where you and your friends shoot the footage on your phone & then cook frozen ravioli or eat peanut butter sandwiches after the shoot. When you do the effects yourself, instead of laughing at it, you can be proud of it, because you did it with dollar store catsup and the big movie did it with million dollar CG and it's more than one one-millionth as good as the big movie's effect.

2019-11-22T10:35:26-05:00	There's one month left in the decade. Most of the time I feel like I've been treading water since 2010. But, come to think of it, during this time I: wrote a book, got articles published in real paying publications, lost my virginity, worked on Xanadu in an official capacity, got a real job, put a game on steam, met & worked with some of my idols, learned to drive, got my own house, and adopted a cat who is now the emotional center of my whole life. I also released dozens of albums of music & wrote many hundreds of pages of prose.

2020-01-07T12:08:37-05:00	Step one in understanding enough of a large undocumented codebase to make the changes you need before the deadline: use doxygen to produce bidirectional call graphs for everything. It cuts the time to trace execution through code by hours. Get good at finding & enabling these settings, because being thrown into large undocumented codebases on a deadline is your job now.

Working full time means being ordered to cut corners & do things you know are wrong just because somebody up the chain read some hype, and then barely having enough energy to feed yourself once you finally get home.

Examples are great when they happen to exactly match what the user already wants to do or when modifying them to match user need is trivial & obvious, but they don't work outside the happy path. If your tool is flexible, you MUST provide enough information for users to understand how to use your tool to do things you haven't imagined yet.

2020-01-21T08:53:57-05:00	Because I'm into weird horror movies & the imagery related to it, I followed a bunch of people who post horror posters & box cover art on instagram, & I ended up stumbling onto two subcultures that I was only vaguely aware of. One is the instagram horror VHS trading scene & the other is the fake box art / fake poster scene. Instagram VHS fake box art/poster scene is much stranger than the reddit/tumblr fake poster scene, which is full of professional graphic designers working digitally. Instagram VHS fake box art seems to be people painting in latex paint on actual VHS boxes and/or VHS-sized pieces of wood and selling them? On instagram?

2020-01-27T12:44:52-05:00	Current norms around meaning-making cannot survive the slow collision with widespread private ownership of duplication & broadcast technologies. Attempts to deal with this through 'trust in institutions' are doomed -- institutions in general have never been trustworthy enough to justify the kind of power we have given them out of necessity, & are prone to exactly the same problems as individual meaning-making is now encountering (though this was less detectable because fewer centers of meaning-making were involved in the age of three TV networks and two newspapers). When we double down on the kind of media literacy that served us well during that era, we get conspiracy culture. What actually could pull us through to a new stable state? Norms about research. Not adequately considering alternative explanations for some piece of information is inconsiderate in exactly the same way as being late for an appointment is -- it means you've wasted someone else's time by considering yours more valuable. We should treat overconfidence -- i.e., a failure to second-guess yourself -- as at least as rude, since it wastes other people's time on an even larger scale.

2020-02-01T18:38:48-05:00	A big part of imagining a better world is building prototypes that allow you to identify and diagnose problems in your world model -- utopian fiction, intentional communities. But balancing the risk here is tricky: utopian fiction only identifies internal contradictions in your model, not inaccuracies, while intentional communities are a kind of human social experiment. So how do we design actual social experiments so that the negative impact of their failure upon participants and non-participants is limited -- preferably without resorting to dependence upon large accumulations of already existing social or financial capital (and thus to institutions whose existence would be threatened by any major and widespread social or political change)?

2020-07-10T19:33:41-04:00	OK, until somebody makes a full-featured desktop SSB client that doesn't involve nodejs, I'm done with it. I tried to install the new binary patchfoo & it broke half my npm packages (including all the ssb-related ones). Spent 2 days & couldn't get any npm packages working again. Node packaging simply isn't acceptably stable & IMO shouldn't be used.

2020-10-12T09:51:21-04:00	nothing is more transgressive than the unclassifiable. 'trash' or 'pulp' culture is important in part because it's the only place where the unclassifiable is reliably allowed to appear: there is no expectation that this media will be worth criticizing, and therefore it is allowed to have those indigestible elements -- social-cultural-political fiber -- that make criticism really worthwhile.

2020-10-12T15:42:20-04:00	Everything worth saying or doing is an active revolt against God, Nature, Good Sense, and Propriety. It is our duty, as thinking beings with will and reason, to revolt in this way. The nature of Nature is to keep the world exactly as shitty as it is now, and we're the only ones equipped to complain, so it's up to us to fix it. We can't, but it's worse not to try.
