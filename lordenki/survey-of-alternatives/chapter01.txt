# Cutting the Gordian Knot: Menuet and Kolibrios

Menuet (also known as MenuetOS) is an operating system first released in the year 2000. Its user interface resembles a conventional WIMP GUI, but it is unique in that its executable format is designed to cater directly to this interface, making it (from the perspective of developers) highly vertically integrated.

Most GUI environments in common use are burdened by compatibility with pre-GUI systems or path dependence stemming from such compatibility that has now been removed. This burden manifests in complexity: even in operating systems like Windows, where few people ever use terminals and command-line applications are rare and awkward to use, it is much easier to make a command-line application than a GUI one because of the initial setup and the amount of awkwardness involved in simple operations like drawing widgets. GUI environments treat the programmatic manipulation of GUI elements as second-class citizens, as a rule. A few exceptions exist (such as rebol, tcl/tk, and smalltalk) but these systems are high-level and (by the standards of the time when they were first developed) heavy-weight. Applications in Menuet are written in flat assembly, and developers are expected to write out the executable header by hand in addition to the application implementation itself.
