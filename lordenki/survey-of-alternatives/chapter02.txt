# TempleOS
\marginnote{Terry Davis' colorful personal life is beyond the scope of this document. It is covered in detail in \cite{knudsentempleos}.}

TempleOS was developed by Terry Davis between 2003 and 2017, and runs on AMD64 hardware. It is as unconventional as Menuet is conventional: a direct statement of Davis' own peculiar philosophy of computing. Some of these elements are idiosyncratic: a 640x480 fixed resolution at 16 colors, single voice PC speaker audio; others can be defended on the grounds that they represent a consistent set of rules for an integrated and user-centric experience: a homogenous system \footnote{In other words, one with a single language used for implementation and interaction. See \cite{homogenous}.}, without networking, multi-user support, or permissions of any kind, with built-in hypermedia documentation.

Both the original TempleOS \footnote{see \cite{templeinstall} for installation instructions} and a fork \footnote{see \cite{shrineos}} are available.
