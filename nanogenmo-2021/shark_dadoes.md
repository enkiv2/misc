"Don't even.", Miss Jessel replied.

 The surf crashed against the cliffs. Barnabas paced. Victoria whistled tonelessly.

"What the hell was that?", said Miss Summers.

"Why are you asking?", Barnabas replied.

"Is it done?"

"You know as well as I do who you should be asking that question. Perhaps you're right."

Miss Jessel started. "What the hell is it?"

Barnabas whistled tonelessly. "It's none of your business."

"Where did he go?"

"There's no use."

"Well now...."

"Is he gone?"

"It doesn't concern you."

"Is he gone?", said Barnabas.

"What do you think?", Willie replied.

"Is it finished?", asked Lord Eaten. Barnabas stormed out.

"Is he gone yet?" Loomis gasped.

Caroline squinted. "Well...."

"What makes you ask?"

"Do you really think so?"

"Where has he gone?" Barnabas stepped into the light.

Lord Eaten stepped into the shadows. "No soap."

"Do you really think so?" Victoria gasped.

The surf crashed against the cliffs. Victoria glared. Barnabas stared into space. Elizabeth gasped.

"What on earth was that?", asked Barnabas. Miss Jessel stormed out.

Barnabas stared into space. 'What on earth could that possibly be?'

Caroline sighed. "Is it done?"

"What do you think?"

Lord Eaten jumped. "Where the hell is it?"

Barnabas whistled tonelessly. "There's no use in asking."

"What the hell was that?", asked Barnabas. Caroline stormed out.

Miss Jessel started. "He couldn't have, could he?", asked Barnabas. Victoria stormed out.

Victoria whistled tonelessly. "Is he gone yet?", asked Elizabeth. Lord Eaten stormed out.

"Why?"

"I'd like to keep that quiet. You have things you like to keep quiet too, don't you? Well now.... Now, I find that hard to believe."

"I know."

The surf crashed against the cliffs. Barnabas glared. Elizabeth kicked at the ground.

"What the hell is it?"

"I can't talk about it."

"That's right."

Victoria started. "Is it finished?", asked Miss Jessel. Caroline stormed out.

Caroline stared into space. Barnabas stepped into the shadows. "Where is it?"

Dr. Freudstein glared. "To tell you the truth, I don't care, and neither should you."

"What the hell was that?"

"You should know better than to ask."

"Where did the damned thing go?"

"It doesn't seem to be any of your business."

"Don't give me that."

Grotesque carvings peered out from the corners of the stone walls, leering in the flickering light. Miss Summers turned. Miss Jessel sighed. Lord Eaten sighed.

Loomis stepped into the light. Elizabeth gasped. 'Where has he gone?'

"What on earth could that be?", asked Dr. Freudstein. Miss Summers stormed out.

"Why do you say that?"

Loomis kicked at the ground. "Where did the damned thing go?"

Barnabas gasped. "There's no use in asking. I'd like to keep that quiet. You have things you like to keep quiet too, don't you? Don't give me that."

"Is it finished?", asked Miss Jessel. Lord Eaten stormed out.

"What is it?"

"I didn't think it was any of your business."

"Maybe there's good left in him yet."

Loomis gasped. 'Why did he do it?'

The fog rose from the graveyard. In the distance, a wolf howled. Willie stepped out of the shadows. Miss Jessel started. Caroline stared into space.

"Why did he do it?", said Dr. Freudstein.

"Do you really want to know the answer to that question?", Elizabeth replied.

Elizabeth stepped into the shadows. "What is it?"

Loomis stepped out of the shadows. "As long as you're paid, and paid well, do you really care?"

"Where did he go?"

"I can't talk about it."

"That's right."

Caroline stepped into the shadows. 'Is it finished?'

Caroline glared. "What was that?" Miss Summers stepped into the light.

Dr. Freudstein paced. "Why do you ask?"

"Now, I find that hard to believe." Loomis started.

"Why?"

"That's my business."

"Perhaps you're right."

 The fog rose from the graveyard. In the distance, a wolf howled.

Lord Eaten gasped. "Why did he do it?"

Miss Jessel paced. "I don't know and I don't care."

"Where has he gone?"

"Do you really want to know?"

Caroline kicked at the ground. 'Where is it?'

"Is he gone?", said Caroline.

"To tell you the truth, I'm not so sure.", Lord Eaten replied.

"Why did he do it?", said Lord Eaten.

"You should know better than to ask.", Lord Eaten replied.

Barnabas glared. "Why?"

"You know who you should be asking."

"You're not going to get any arguments from me."

 These are mysterious days at Colinwood. Miss Summers stepped into the shadows.

"Is he gone?"

"It's none of your business."

Loomis started. "Where is it?"

Elizabeth stepped into the shadows. "You know who you should be asking."

Miss Summers whistled tonelessly. Victoria stepped out of the shadows. 'He couldn't have, could he?'

"What on earth could that be?"

"Do you really want the answer to that question?"

Elizabeth brooded. 'Where the hell did it go?'

"Is he gone yet?" Victoria stormed out.

Loomis stepped into the shadows. "Why?"

"I know." Barnabas stepped into the light.

Elizabeth started. "What did he do?"

Elizabeth stared into space. "There's no use."

"Is he gone?", said Miss Jessel.

"Remaining ignorant on this count is good for your health.", Miss Jessel replied.

"Why on earth could that possibly be?", asked Victoria. Miss Summers stormed out.

"Why on earth could that possibly be?", said Miss Summers.

"You know as well as I do who you should be asking that question.", Loomis replied.

Grotesque carvings peered out from the corners of the stone walls, leering in the flickering light.

"Why on earth could that possibly be?", said Dr. Freudstein.

"There is more going on than you know.", Caroline replied.

"What the hell is it?" Miss Jessel brooded.

Lord Eaten jumped. "Do you really want to know the answer to that question?"

Elizabeth stepped out of the shadows. "That's my business."

"He couldn't have, could he?"

"There is more going on than I know, and it scares me."

Willie stepped into the light. Caroline glared. "Where the hell did it go?", asked Victoria. Barnabas stormed out.

Willie started. 'Where has he gone?'

Lord Eaten kicked at the ground. 'Is it done?'

Dr. Freudstein stepped into the shadows. "What on earth was that?"

Miss Summers stepped out of the shadows. "It doesn't concern you."

The cobwebs hung heavy from the candlestick. Elizabeth brooded.

"Is he gone?" Loomis squinted.

Caroline stepped into the light. "Do you really want the answer to that question?"

"Don't give me that." Lord Eaten glared.

"Why did he do it?", asked Lord Eaten. Elizabeth stormed out.

The rain lashed in sheets. Loomis stepped into the shadows. Elizabeth turned. Loomis stared into space.

Elizabeth gasped. "Where the hell is it?"

Barnabas stepped out of the shadows. "That's my business."

"What was that?", said Elizabeth.

"There's no use in asking.", Lord Eaten replied.

"What on earth could that be?" Victoria stepped into the shadows.

Barnabas turned. "You know who you should be asking."

"Now, I find that hard to believe." Dr. Freudstein stepped into the light.

"What the hell was that?", asked Caroline. Loomis stormed out.

"Why on earth could that possibly be?" Loomis sighed.

Caroline started. "I can't talk about it."

"Why?"

"It shouldn't concern you."

"What is it?" Lord Eaten kicked at the ground.

Dr. Freudstein stared into space. "Do you really want to know the answer to that question?"

"Well now...." Barnabas jumped.

"Where has he gone?"

"That should be the least of your worries.How should I know?"

"I know."

Caroline turned. 'Where is he?'

Barnabas brooded. "He couldn't have, could he?" Victoria glared.

Lord Eaten stepped out of the light. "That's my business."

"I'll drink to that." Victoria sighed.

"Where is he?"

"How can that be?"

"It shouldn't concern you."

"Do you really think so?"

The rain lashed in sheets.

Willie turned. "What on earth was that?"

Elizabeth squinted. "What if I'm wrong?"

"What on earth was that?" Loomis brooded.

Elizabeth squinted. "Why are you asking?"

"I see." Caroline gasped.

"Where the hell did it go?", said Lord Eaten.

"Well....", Dr. Freudstein replied.

Victoria kicked at the ground. "Where did the damned thing go?"

Miss Jessel turned. "Do you really want to know? No soap, huh? There's no point in hiding it from me."

"Where did he go?"

"I don't care, and neither should you."

"Where has he gone?"

"It's none of your business."

Willie turned. 'Where did the damned thing go?'

"Why did he do that?"

"As long as you're paid, and paid well, do you really care?"

"What is that?", said Victoria.

"There is more going on than you know.", Victoria replied.

"What on earth was that?", asked Miss Summers. Miss Summers stormed out.

"Is he gone yet?"

Loomis paced. "To tell you the truth, I'm not so sure."

"I'll drink to that." Dr. Freudstein whistled tonelessly.

Elizabeth squinted. "What on earth could that possibly be?"

Victoria paced. "It doesn't seem to be any of your business."

Elizabeth gasped. 'What the hell is it?'

 These are mysterious days at Colinwood. Barnabas stepped out of the shadows. Miss Summers whistled tonelessly. Miss Jessel stared into space.

Miss Jessel jumped. 'What the hell was that?'

"Is he gone?", said Caroline.

"I didn't think it was any of your business.", Elizabeth replied.

The cobwebs hung heavy from the candlestick.

"Where is he?" Lord Eaten stepped out of the light.

Lord Eaten stepped out of the shadows. "You should know better than to ask."

"You're not going to get any arguments from me." Miss Jessel stared into space.

Willie gasped. 'Where did the damned thing go?'

 Grotesque carvings peered out from the corners of the stone walls, leering in the flickering light. Loomis squinted. Elizabeth jumped. Victoria stepped out of the shadows.

Barnabas squinted. 'Where did he go?'

Lord Eaten brooded. "What on earth was that?", asked Elizabeth. Lord Eaten stormed out.

Elizabeth squinted. "Why did he do that?"

Victoria gasped. "Remaining ignorant on this count is good for your health."

"How can that be?" Miss Jessel squinted.

Miss Jessel squinted. "Perhaps...."

"You're not going to get any arguments from me." Elizabeth stepped into the light.

"Have you done it?", asked Willie. Caroline stormed out.

Dr. Freudstein stepped into the shadows. Elizabeth kicked at the ground. "Why did you do that?"

Miss Summers turned. "Don't ask me."

Elizabeth whistled tonelessly. "Why?"

Barnabas turned. "It's none of your business."

"Where is he?"

"What do you mean by that? Why do you say that?"

"Is it done?"

"Well, uh.... In this particular instance, I'm not so sure."

Miss Jessel glared. 'Why did he do it?'

"Where the hell did it go?", asked Miss Summers. Miss Jessel stormed out.

"What was that?"

"Well, uh.... In this particular instance, I'm not so sure."

Caroline stepped into the light. 'Why did he do it?'

"Why did he do it?"

"It's none of your business."

Barnabas stepped out of the shadows. 'What the hell is it?'

Loomis sighed. 'What the hell is it?'

"Where is he?"

"Sometimes it's better not to talk. No soap, huh?"

"I know."

"What the hell is it?"

"Well...."

"Why?", said Lord Eaten.

"I can't talk about it.", Miss Summers replied.

"What is that?", asked Dr. Freudstein. Loomis stormed out.

 The fog rose from the graveyard. In the distance, a wolf howled.

"Why did he do that?"

"Do you really want to know?"

"Where is it?"

"Perhaps.... What on earth was that?"

"Why did he do that?", said Dr. Freudstein.

"Well....", Barnabas replied.

"Where did he go?"

"It doesn't seem to be any of your business."

Willie started. "Why did you do that?" Loomis sighed.

Lord Eaten kicked at the ground. "What do you think?"

 The cobwebs hung heavy from the candlestick.

"Is he gone yet?" Loomis sighed.

Loomis kicked at the ground. "As long as you're paid, and paid well, do you really care?"

"Don't give me that." Miss Jessel whistled tonelessly.

Caroline glared. Lord Eaten jumped. "Is it finished?"

"Don't ask me that question. No soap."

"Perhaps you're right."



*



The rain lashed in sheets. Willie whistled tonelessly. Loomis stormed out. Barnabas paced.

Victoria started. "What is it?"

"Why are you asking? What is it?"

Loomis squinted. 'What the hell is it?'

Victoria gasped. 'How can that be?'

Lord Eaten squinted. 'Is it done?'

Caroline started. Miss Summers stepped out of the shadows. "What is it?"

Lightning flashes, illuminating the barred windows. Lord Eaten squinted. Elizabeth stepped into the shadows. Barnabas stepped out of the light.

"What the hell is it?"

"To tell you the truth, I don't care, and neither should you."

"Where did it go?", said Dr. Freudstein.

"That's my business.", Miss Jessel replied.

"Have you done it?"

"No soap."

"That's right."

Dr. Freudstein stepped into the shadows. "He couldn't have, could he?" Loomis stepped out of the light.

Caroline kicked at the ground. "That's my business."

"You're not going to get any arguments from me." Victoria stepped into the shadows.

Miss Summers turned. "Why did he do it?", said Elizabeth.

"There is more going on than you know."

"No soap, huh?"

"Do you really want to know the answer to that question? Perhaps you're right. You've stood in my way long enough."

Caroline stepped out of the light. "Is he gone yet?"

Caroline paced. "Do you really want the answer to that question?"

"Why did he do it?"

"I didn't think it was any of your business."

"How can that be?"

"What if I'm wrong?"

"Now, I find that hard to believe."

"What is that?"

"I'd like to keep that quiet. You have things you like to keep quiet too, don't you?"

"Where did it go?"

"It doesn't concern you."

"Perhaps you're right."

"Where did it go?" Willie squinted.

"What do you mean by that?"

"I'll drink to that."

"What the hell is it?"

"I can't talk about it."

"Why did he do that?"

"You should know better than to ask."

"Now, I find that hard to believe."

Caroline whistled tonelessly. "Why did you do that?"

"I'd like to keep that quiet. You have things you like to keep quiet too, don't you?"

"Don't give me that."

 These are mysterious days at Colinwood. Dr. Freudstein glared. Caroline jumped.

"Where the hell is it?", said Willie.

"Don't even.", Elizabeth replied.

"What is it?"

"Don't even."

"Well now...."

Lord Eaten stepped out of the shadows. "Where the hell is it?"

"You know who you should be asking."

"I know."

The fog rose from the graveyard. In the distance, a wolf howled. Elizabeth brooded. Elizabeth stormed out. Willie sighed.

"Why did he do it?", said Barnabas.

"To tell you the truth, I don't care, and neither should you.", Barnabas replied.

"What was that?"

"That should be the least of your worries.How should I know? I see."

"I see."

Victoria paced. "Why?", asked Barnabas. Victoria stormed out.

Barnabas stepped out of the shadows. "Is he gone yet?", said Loomis.

"No soap.", Dr. Freudstein replied.



*



The rain lashed in sheets. Willie kicked at the ground. Elizabeth kicked at the ground. Caroline brooded.

Barnabas whistled tonelessly. "Is it finished?", said Willie.

"Sometimes it's better not to talk.", Victoria replied.

"Where the hell did it go?", said Miss Summers.

"Remaining ignorant on this count is good for your health.", Loomis replied.

Lord Eaten stepped out of the light. Elizabeth sighed. 'What the hell is it?'

Miss Summers stepped into the shadows. Loomis stepped out of the shadows. 'Where did it go?'



*

 Grotesque carvings peered out from the corners of the stone walls, leering in the flickering light. Loomis stared into space. Willie stepped into the light.

Victoria jumped. 'Where did he go?'

Victoria turned. 'Is it done?'



*

 Lightning flashes, illuminating the barred windows. Miss Jessel stormed out. Caroline gasped. Elizabeth stepped into the shadows.

Willie kicked at the ground. 'Is it done?'

"What is that?"

"Don't ask me."

"What the hell is it?", said Miss Jessel.

"Why?", Lord Eaten replied.

"What did he do?"

"Do you really want to know the answer to that question?"

"No soap, huh?"

"Is it finished?"

"You know as well as I do. Maybe there's good left in him yet."

"There's no point in hiding it from me."

Victoria brooded. "What was that?"

"I don't care, and neither should you."

"Don't give me that."

 Grotesque carvings peered out from the corners of the stone walls, leering in the flickering light. Lord Eaten stepped into the shadows. Dr. Freudstein kicked at the ground. Willie sighed.

Victoria stepped out of the light. "What the hell was that?"

Barnabas stared into space. "Don't ask me."

"Is he gone?", asked Loomis. Willie stormed out.

Elizabeth stormed out. "What the hell was that?"

Caroline whistled tonelessly. "There is more going on than you know."

"Why did he do it?" Loomis stormed out.

Miss Summers jumped. "Well, uh.... In this particular instance, I'm not so sure."

"There's no point in hiding it from me." Barnabas paced.

"Where did it go?"

"I didn't think it was any of your business."

Lord Eaten jumped. "What was that?"

"Sometimes it's better not to talk."

"Don't give me that."

Willie stepped into the light. 'He couldn't have, could he?'

"What on earth could that be?" Dr. Freudstein kicked at the ground.

Victoria stepped out of the light. "That should be the least of your worries.How should I know?"

"Well now...." Elizabeth started.

"Where is it?" Barnabas glared.

Dr. Freudstein whistled tonelessly. "It doesn't concern you."

"Do you really think so?" Loomis stormed out.

Miss Summers gasped. Caroline started. 'Where the hell is it?'

Loomis stepped out of the light. "Do you have any idea why?"

Miss Summers started. "What makes you ask?"

Caroline paced. 'Have you done it?'

"What was that?"

"I don't know and I don't care."

Loomis stormed out. Dr. Freudstein sighed. "He couldn't have, could he?"

"You know as well as I do who you should be asking that question."

"Maybe there's good left in him yet."

Victoria stepped out of the light. "Where did it go?"

"I didn't think it was any of your business."

Loomis stormed out. "Where did it go?"

Willie kicked at the ground. "Don't ask me that question."

"Where did it go?", said Dr. Freudstein.

"It shouldn't concern you.", Lord Eaten replied.

"What is that?", said Willie.

"Why do you ask?", Victoria replied.

Miss Summers stared into space. 'What was that?'

The surf crashed against the cliffs. Lord Eaten stormed out. Caroline stormed out. Caroline stepped into the light.

Victoria jumped. "Have you done it?"

Willie whistled tonelessly. "As long as you're paid, and paid well, do you really care?"

"He couldn't have, could he?"

"That's my business."

"Now, I find that hard to believe."

"What was that?", asked Miss Summers. Dr. Freudstein stormed out.

Miss Summers brooded. "He couldn't have, could he?"

Dr. Freudstein brooded. "Well...."

"Why on earth could that possibly be?"

"It doesn't seem to be any of your business."

"He couldn't have, could he?" Lord Eaten whistled tonelessly.

Lord Eaten squinted. "As long as you're paid, and paid well, do you really care?"

"Don't give me that." Caroline stormed out.

"What on earth was that?"

"Why?"

"Where is he?", said Loomis.

"To tell you the truth, I'm not so sure.", Dr. Freudstein replied.

"Sometimes it's better not to talk.", Barnabas replied.

Willie stared into space. 'Why on earth could that possibly be?'

Willie stared into space. "Where did he go?", asked Elizabeth. Miss Summers stormed out.

"Where the hell is it?"

"There is more going on than I know, and it scares me."

"Don't give me that."

 The rain lashed in sheets. Victoria stepped out of the light. Lord Eaten started.

Barnabas stepped into the shadows. "Do you really want the answer to that question? Maybe there's good left in him yet. You're not going to get any arguments from me."

"What is that?", said Lord Eaten.

"What do you think?", Dr. Freudstein replied.

"What on earth could that be?"

"Well...."
